      CHAPTER I.&mdash;On Unknown Shores.

      <i>Pursued by Our Dying Ship. Cast Away Among Dangers. A Pointing Finger
      and a Sword. Beguiled by Savage Royalty. A Strange Girl and a Prediction.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N range of my
      outlook seaward as I lay on the yellow strand was a grotesque figure
      standing near and gazing inland. His powerful frame was broad and squat;
      his long arms, ending with immense hands, hung loosely at his sides; his
      hair was ragged; and out of his blank face blue eyes wide apart. So
      accustomed was I to his habitually placid expression that the keenness
      with which he was looking roused me fully out of the lethargy into which
      extreme exhaustion had plunged me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Christopher!&rdquo; I said with an attempt at cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange look in my serving-man&rsquo;s eyes did not disappear when he turned
      them on me at my greeting, but my glance at the forest discovered nothing
      alarming. It was useless to question Christopher; he would take his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose with stiffened members. The wretched, beaten colonists were prone
      along the beach, all sleeping except Captain Mason and Mr. Vancouver. With
      silent Christopher shambling at my heels I passed Mr. Vancouver as he sat
      on the sand beside his slumbering daughter; he was watching the sea more
      with his blue lips than his leaden eyes. I gave him a cheery greeting,
      blinked small since it was no time to harbor old scores. The effort
      failed; he only blinked at me. Already I had suspected that his quarrel
      with me because Christopher had stowed away on the vessel was merely the
      seizing of an opportunity to rupture the strong friendship between Annabel
      and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at a distance I had seen that Captain Mason&rsquo;s spirit was hunting the
      waters, as he stood apart in a splendid solitude, arms folded, and
      towering in the dignity of a gladiator who might be disarmed, but not
      conquered. Never had I seen a profounder pathos than his when, finding the
      <i>Hope</i> foundering and helpless, he had ordered her abandonment and
      sent us into the boats. Then had come the most haunting thing that ever a
      sailor experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the pursuit of us by the dying barkentine. What sails the last
      storm had left played crazy pranks with the derelict. With no hand on her
      wheel the rudder swung free. We were rowing northwestwardly, with the
      wind, and thus it was that the <i>Hope</i>, thrust by wind and wave,
      followed us, with wide swerves, with lungings and lurchings, now and then
      making a graceful sweep up a swell and then a wallowing roll to the
      trough. The fore-and-aft sails were gone, but some of the square canvas
      held; and the sheets flapped with a dismal foolishness between accidental
      fills. It was the drunken plunging of the hulk in deliberate pursuit of us
      that appalled. She snouted the water swinishly; she reeled and groveled
      under the seas that boarded her. Through it all, whether she was coming
      prow first, beam on, or stern foremost, and no matter how far she would
      veer, she clung to our course, shadowing us, hounding us, as though
      imploring our help.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the fury of the storms, from their first assaults at Cape Horn to
      their beating us down in the South Seas, Captain Mason had not faltered;
      he fought desperate odds with the cunning and valor of Hercules. But this
      careering mad thing, stripped of the grace and dignity of a sane ship,&mdash;this
      staggering, sodden monster, mortally stricken and dumbly floundering after
      the master who had abandoned her that she might go down alone into the
      deep,&mdash;was more than the man could bear; and he had sat staring in
      the boat, Christopher and I rowing, while we dodged the barkentine&rsquo;s blind
      assaults. We were still bending to the work when darkness fell. It was
      then that the wind died, and we saw her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason showed relief at being dragged back into the living world by
      our approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sign of her?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from here. The view is shut in by those promontories,&rdquo; indicating two
      headlands embracing our beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Christopher will scale one of them and I the other.&rdquo; &lt;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint twinkle behind the seaman&rsquo;s look, and something else,
      which recalled what I had seen in Christopher&rsquo;s face as he gazed at the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine you haven&rsquo;t slept much,&rdquo; I said, knowing his anxiety on the
      barkentine&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I, Mr. Tudor, when she had been following me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have already been up there to see if you could find her?&rdquo; I
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked amused as he drawled, &ldquo;Not all the way,&rdquo; and gave Christopher a
      look that appeared to be understood. His gesture swept the heights on
      either side and the richly verdured mountains that began to spring in
      terraces a short distance from the beach. &ldquo;This is a tropical region,&rdquo; he
      went on, &ldquo;and those trees bear lively fruit. It is brown and carries
      swords. I didn&rsquo;t get all the way to the headland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood, and inquired, &ldquo;Did they speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A pointing finger with a sword behind it needs no words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered where we could be, that armed natives should exhibit a hostile
      attitude. &ldquo;Where are we stranded?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It has been weeks since I could even take a dead reckoning,
      and we&rsquo;ve been blown far since then. My instruments disappeared while I
      was exploring this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are without food or weapons,&rdquo; I added, feeling a thrill at the
      prospect of measuring forces with an obscure menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver had loaded the barkentine with every possible means of
      defense, subsistence, and development, but we had fallen on an island far
      short of the one in the Philippines which he intended to colonize. The
      fate of the <i>Hope</i> was a vital matter. Most of her precious cargo was
      behind bulkheads. If she had not gone down, very likely she would drift to
      this island and yield her resources to any enemies we might encounter
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was gazing at the forest again. I could see only deep shadows
      and brown tree-boles under the leafage. Birds of brilliant plumage were
      flitting among the trees, and the warmth of the sun bathed us in sweet,
      heavy odors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming, sir,&rdquo; said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed a slow undulation in a wide arc among the shadows. A tree-trunk
      in the outer edge apparently detached itself, then advanced into the open,
      halted, and raised a sword. Five hundred other shapes came forth from the
      wide semi-circle touching the shore at either end. Some bore swords,
      others spears, and still others knotted war-clubs. The soldiers were brown
      and bareheaded, and the dress of each was limited to the loins, except
      that of the leader, the man who had first stepped out; he wore a sort of
      tunic or light cloak, and a head-dress, both gaudily illuminated with
      feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; I impatiently cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher left us and rapidly roused the sleepers. He must have dropped
      reassuring words, for the stir proceeded without panic, though all could
      see the advancing threat, which approached with an ominous deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s to be a slaughter, Captain?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave no answer, being evidently stunned. I turned to Christopher as he
      rejoined us. Many a time since I had rescued him from a mob of boys in a
      Boston street, taken him to my lodgings, and made him my servant, his
      strange mind had seemed able to penetrate baffling obscurities. At such
      times he had a way of listening, as though to voices which he alone could
      hear; but with that was an extraordinary reticence of tongue, and often an
      indirection that had tried my patience until I learned to understand him
      as well as an ordinary mortal could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they going to kill us, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a deep abstraction, and I knew he was listening. &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his usual way of gaining time, and I had learned to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they going to kill us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill us, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are asking me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are they going to kill us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, sir,&rdquo; he firmly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glance which Captain Mason and I exchanged was one accepting
      Christopher&rsquo;s opinion and groping for what lay beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some accuracy of maneuvering, the leader aligned his soldiers,
      stepped out after halting them fifty yards away, and stood waiting,
      obviously for a parley. He was showing impatience as Captain Mason still
      stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one must meet him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It will never do to show timidity. You
      are the fittest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These people are strange to me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know how to
      proceed. They have an appearance of ferocity that I have never seen in
      these seas. Many outside men must have drifted to this island, but I&rsquo;ll
      warrant that none ever left it, for I&rsquo;ve never heard of anything that
      looks just like this. I imagine it is the graveyard of the unreported
      wrecks that happen in this part of the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised at the grayness in his face and the glaze in his eyes.
      What could our two hundred and fifty men, women, and children, helpless as
      they were, do without his shrewdness and courage?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have all the more to do,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He squared himself, and said: &ldquo;We three will meet them. Put yourself
      forward. Your height and strength will impress them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It looked odd that he did not include Mr. Vancouver, the leader of our
      enterprise, and Lee Rawley, the aristocratic and disdainful young lawyer
      whom Mr. Vancouver hoped that Annabel would marry.

      Meanwhile, the leader of the savages, a man of commanding size and manner,
      had been growing more impatient, and was putting his men through some
      manual that hinted at barbarous proceeding; but when we started he
      desisted, and met us with urbane gestures. Then ensued a struggle to find
      a means of communication. Both Captain Mason and I knew something of the
      Pacific languages, he from a sailor&rsquo;s experience and I from having fought
      as a first lieutenant in the Philippines during the war with Spain; but
      apparently our combined resources failed. Finally we caught a Spanish word
      and then a German. It remained for Christopher to discover that the
      embassador spoke some pidgin-English with his tongue and all languages
      with his gestures. Thus we learned that the gracious King Rangan had sent
      Gato, commander-in-chief of the army, with an escort of honor to conduit
      us to the imperial presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason and I carefully avoided each other&rsquo;s eyes. The tomb-like
      mask that Christopher knew how to wear was on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there were two armed savages to each colonist throat, there was nothing
      to do but accept. In a dismal procession guarded by the soldiers, we
      labored through the sand and sank into the scented forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a walk through flagrant aisles of shade and color, we came upon a
      wide sweep where the undergrowth had been cleared away; in its place was a
      cluster of huts made of bamboo and thatch. The central space was occupied
      by one more imposing than the others. The matting curtain at the door was
      drawn aside after we had been seated before it on the ground, and a sturdy
      figure, followed by a striking retinue, came forth and took an elevated
      seat on a platform extending from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s gorgeous robe of a light fabric adorned with feathers and
      embroidered with gold was worn with a knowledge of its impressiveness. A
      wide band of gold embedded with gems served for a crown; the blazing
      scepter and massive wristlets and anklets were of like materials; the ears
      and fingers flashed with jewels. The royal face was benignant. Gato
      stepped forth to interpret, as the king&rsquo;s immediate followers, dressed in
      long embroidered garments of native texture, ranged about the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant swinging a large feather fan over the king&rsquo;s head was the
      only woman discoverable. There was a striking difference between her and
      the men. It was manifest in a prouder poise of the head, in a look of
      higher intelligence, and in a finer definition of features. The eagerness
      with which her glance ran over us, a shyness that struggled with an
      impulse to a bolder scrutiny, combined with a certain refinement of
      bearing to set her apart. She was raimented with no less barbaric splendor
      than the king and his immediate attendants, but in better taste. Her brown
      bare arms and neck were turned on the graceful lines of youth, and her
      wrists and hands were small. Her hair, instead of having the glistening
      blackness of the men&rsquo;s, housed some of the sun&rsquo;s gold; and I was startled
      to discover finally that her eyes were a deep blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her roving glance was caught and held by me. In her eyes was a
      moment of hungry inquiry. She caught her breath; a break came in the
      regular swing of the fan, and her eyelids drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fascinated attention to her was diverted by a deep rumble. King Rangan
      was speaking.

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;The Falling of a Fong
    </h2>

      <i>A Royal Feast. The Fan-Bearer&rsquo;s Significant Conduct. A Gloomy Forecast.
      Had Any Before Us Escaped? The King&rsquo;s Promise. Prisoned in Paradise.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE interpreter
      made a genuflection to the throne, and beckoned to Captain Mason and me. I
      thought that Mr. Vancouver ought to be included, but the skipper ignored
      my inquiring glance, and stepped forward. After bowing, we stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king gave us a shrewd look. Then his eyes blazed, and he ripped out
      something to the interpreter. I discovered the cause. My faithful
      Christopher had brought up his prodigious strength for a possible
      emergency, and it was clear that the king was offended by the grotesque
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter hesitated, for he knew Christopher&rsquo;s speech-value, and the
      king snapped out another command. I knew it was an order that some shame
      be put upon Christopher. At that my muscles hardened, and I stepped
      protectingly before him. The fan over the king&rsquo;s head abruptly stopped.
      The leader raised his hand, and a dozen of his men advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly aware that Captain Mason was employing some pacific measures, I was
      more concerned by Annabel&rsquo;s surprising act. Her eyes shining and her
      cheeks aglow, she briskly came up, laid her hand on Christopher&rsquo;s arm, and
      sweetly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and stay back here with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His pathetic look went questioningly from her to me, and he held his
      ground. I glanced round to see what next the king would do. With
      astonishment or wonder the fan-bearer was staring at Annabel, who made a
      striking picture; then she whispered into the royal ear. In a milder voice
      he said something to the interpreter, who by a gesture to us indicated
      that the king was satisfied. At a word from me, Christopher came and stood
      beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ostensible purpose proved to be merely a formal welcome, an
      ascertainment of our origin, purpose, and disaster, and an invitation to a
      feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the others of the colony were in too dull a state to give attention,
      the king confined to us three a shrewd scrutiny. But Captain Mason and I,
      feeling that the welcome was only a sheathed sword, held blank faces, and
      did not even pass a glance of understanding; and Christopher could be
      depended on under all circumstances to give no betraying sign. The one
      thing to do was to show a grateful acquiescence. The time for planning
      would come when our people were capable of thought and action,&mdash;if we
      should be spared that long.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a feast. The smoke which Christopher had seen rose from a
      barbecue, at which fresh meat and fowls and fish had been deliciously
      cooked. The completeness of the preparations indicated that they must have
      been begun immediately after our landing. Fragrant boughs were spread on
      the ground near the barbecue trench, and on them we seated ourselves.
      Plantain leaves made excellent platters. Roasted yams, bread made of
      ground seed or grain, and fruits of many kinds, were served in abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was magical; the down-hearted took cheer, and laughter ran
      through the trees. Much of the transformation was wrought by the
      solicitous attentions of the servers; but more cheering was the gracious
      friendliness of the king, who, besides personally directing the service,
      mingled with us in a democratic way, yet with no sacrifice of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most fascinating to me was the fan-bearer. Whereas the warriors stood in
      awe of his Majesty, she treated him with almost a flippant disregard. She
      went among the colonists, keenly anxious that all should be pleased, her
      face breaking into bewitching smiles, her mischievous eyes dancing, her
      musical laugh rippling. The distinction in her manner as she had stood
      behind the throne was augmented in the modest abandon of her rôle of
      hostess. The alertness of her glance, the joyous spirits that bubbled out
      of her light pose and movement, her sprite-like airiness, her obvious
      efforts to restrain an instinct to play, to tease, to get into mischief, a
      running over of kindness and happiness,&mdash;these and more elusive
      qualities set her apart from the men and made them look dull and sordid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her greatest interest was in Annabel, the only highly cultured woman in
      our party, since the colony was composed of workers in practical
      industries. The two girls had no language in common, and appeared sharply
      different in temperament and training; yet there was visible between them
      a bond of feminine sympathy such as no man can understand. It was curious
      that the savage one was not abashed before her highly civilized sister. In
      the gentle eagerness with which she served Annabel, frankly studied her,
      and courted her notice, was something that looked pathetically like the
      yearning of a starved soul for what Annabel had&mdash;the enjoyment of a
      birthright. Annabel appeared to see that longing, and she stretched forth
      a friendly hand into the fan-bearer&rsquo;s darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason, Christopher, and I formed a group. Despite the grief and
      anxiety on the sailor&rsquo;s face, he betrayed his share of the sunshine that
      the girl bestowed on all. She came to us often, and there was a touch of
      shyness not visible when she flitted among the others. Virtually ignoring
      me, she gave some attention to the captain, and was particularly
      solicitous toward Christopher. She stuffed him, and laughed at him.
      Christopher enjoyed it, gazed up into her sparkling eyes, and strained his
      ribs with the food that she coaxingly urged upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of her visits I smilingly handed her a little pocket toilet-case
      which I carried. She took it gingerly, examined it curiously, and with
      childish interest inspected its contents. Her surprise at discovering the
      mirror was not so great as I had expected, and did not look quite sincere.
      She held it up, made a grimace at her reflection, thrust out at it a
      tongue as sweet and pink as a baby&rsquo;s, tossed the kit back at me, and went
      dancing off in a swirl of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she demurely returned on a pretense of looking after
      Christopher&rsquo;s wants, and of a sudden, brilliantly smiling, held out her
      hand for the trinket. I gave it to her. Her eyes fell when I looked up
      closely into them, and in agitation she thrust the case into her bosom. I
      discovered that Annabel was curiously observing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason gazed thoughtfully after her as she left, and remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl is going to be mixed up with our fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An eaglet hatched by buzzards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher&rsquo;s evident regard for her was dazzled wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like her, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was serious at all times, and much of his gravity was sadness. He
      nodded impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has fed you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He spread his immense hands over his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask her to bring you some more,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face showed alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sir! I&rsquo;d shorely bust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t have to eat more, even if she brought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d jess <i>have</i> to, sir.&rdquo; This with a solemn helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken her measure,&rdquo; dryly remarked Captain Mason.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found opportunity to study the splendid jewels so abundantly
      adorning the king and the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those gems,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were cut by European lapidaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a disturbing suggestion in his words, but I could not define it.
      This island had received rich treasures from civilization. Here was a
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you account for them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The typhoon makes many wrecks. There&rsquo;s no knowing what shores they crawl
      up on to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you see that although our ship was wrecked, we came ashore.
      Survivors of other wrecks likely have had the same experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why haven&rsquo;t they given out news of this island? It is evidently
      very rich, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me an obscure look, and turned away with the remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find the reason in a few hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He must have felt the hurt in my silence, and opened a confidence on
      another tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have noticed, Mr. Tudor, that there are no women, children, nor
      domestic animals in this village. Do you infer anything from that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your inference, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The village is not inhabited. The natives live back of those mountains to
      the west. This is merely a receiving-station for wrecks and castaways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shrewdness of the king was not hidden by his hospitality. I did not
      overlook the inquiries that he made among the colonists with Gato&rsquo;s help,
      nor his private colloquy with Mr. Vancouver, nor the thoughtful look of
      that gentleman when it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet was ended; the colony was reassembled before the throne; the
      king, backed by his now sedate fan-wielder, seated himself; and Captain
      Mason, Christopher, and I stood ready. We were made to understand the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not been invited to this island, but the misfortune that landed us
      on it would be respected. Two circumstances ruled the situation. One was
      that no vessels from the outside world ever put in here, and hence our
      means of escape were restricted to such resources as the king might
      devise; the other, that our intercourse with the people would not be
      permitted beyond a certain limit. The king explained that in youth he had
      gone abroad and found that the ways of white people were not suited to the
      islanders, who would be demoralized should they come under our
      civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals he sent his people, two or three at a time, in a small boat
      to the nearest islands, some hundreds of miles away, with native products
      for barter. But so great had been their precautions that the situation of
      the island had never been discovered. In these boats one or two of us
      would be taken away at a time, and thus placed in the path of ships that
      would assist us homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to keep us isolated from the people, we were to be conduced at
      once to a pleasant valley, which would be free to us for our exclusive
      use. Natives skilled in farming would be furnished us for a time as
      instructors; but it would be expected that we should pledge our honor not
      to make any attempt to leave the valley without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every heart among us sank. A deep look was in Captain Mason&rsquo;s eyes. It was
      on the end of my tongue to say, &ldquo;Captain, let him know that we can make
      our own vessels and leave in them;&rdquo; but a glance at him informed me that
      he had forgotten nothing, and that anything but a cheerful acceptance of
      the old bandit&rsquo;s conditions, until we might devise and execute plans of
      our own, would precipitate immediate disaster. And then I understood why
      the captain had asked no question about the barkentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to me, under his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an easy tongue. We must keep our people blind for the present.
      Brace them up and flatter the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were in the apathy of weariness and repletion. The glow with
      which I put the situation to them was barely needed to secure their
      acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to the king. Only with difficulty could I see him clearly through
      the intensely dramatic picture made by the girl. All through the
      conference I had seen her intense anxiety. What did it mean? With her
      sweet audacity, she might have made some sign. As I read her conduct, it
      betrayed a terrible uneasiness lest we refuse or were ungracious. Clearly
      she was greatly relieved by our acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked the king and gratefully accepted his proffers. He then informed
      us that we should immediately be conducted to our valley, made
      comfortable, and supplied with everything needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalcade, conduced by the armed guard, started through the enchanted
      forest, and mysteries throbbed in the very air. Never had I seen so
      pathetic a spectacle as this draggling procession of civilized people
      marched as dumb cattle to the shambles by a horde of savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason, Christopher, and I stood apart as the others filed past.
      The man of the sea was in a deep reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the king,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;has been so careful to conceal this island from
      the world, why should he plan sending us away to betray it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason gave me a slow look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that he intends to send us away?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, he hasn&rsquo;t sent other castaways off, and we&rsquo;ll find them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that slow look, but I felt that it saw too far to include me. He
      shook his head, and said, as though talking to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now begins the great struggle. We&rsquo;ll be patient&mdash;and ready. That
      girl is our hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king descended; the fan-bearer, her face mantled with content,
      disappeared within the administration hut and dropped the curtain. The
      rear guard were waiting for us three, and we started. After a few paces, I
      turned, and saw, as I had hoped to see, a brown face watching us through
      the parted curtain, and it was filled with more mysteries than any
      enchanted forest ever held.
    </p>
    <p>
      On and up we went, and finally reached the summit. We stood on a small
      open plateau, which abruptly ended in a precipice. Before us was a giant
      chasm in a great tableland of lava. The floor was a thousand feet below.
      We were looking down on it from the top of the great wall of columnar
      basalt which enclosed it. The chasm was an irregular ellipse, some three
      miles on its minor axis and five on its major. The floor was level, and,
      except for some farms, was covered with a forest. A breeze sent long,
      unctuous waves of lighter green rolling over it, or swirling in graceful
      spirals where the wall deflected the wind and drifted it on in majestic
      eddies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In splendid contrast to the deep, warm colors below was the gloomy black
      of the mighty enclosing rampart. Near the upper end a beautiful stream,
      nearly a river in size, made a wild, joyous leap over the brink. A lake
      into which the water plunged sent up clouds of mist, out of which sprang a
      rainbow. From the lake ran the stream of molten silver which swung lazily
      on its shining way through the valley till lost in the distance. The
      leader of the guard announced that the valley was our destination. I was
      dumb in the grasp of its witchery, but a quiet voice brought me back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As good a prison as another.&rdquo; Captain Mason had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that is Paradise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; but the flaming sword will keep us in, not out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the march I had not failed to keep Christopher in the corner of my
      eye. I had been trying to read in his face one of those flashes of insight
      which his fine instinct sometimes threw into dark places. He had held his
      listening attitude often since I found him standing beside me on the sand.
      It had given his face a certain leaden alertness, which, as we beheld the
      valley, slowly faded into the habitual blankness, and I saw that it was
      useless to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We descended through a steep, narrow cleft, and were marched through a
      forest to the stream. A rude bridge bore us across, and there we found a
      large number of natives rapidly and skilfully building us a village of
      huts made from logs, boughs, and thatch. From all indications, they must
      have begun the work almost immediately after we landed. Large stores of
      food and other necessities had been accumulated; nothing needed for our
      comfort and sustenance had been neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the soldiers had helped us bring order to the camp and the
      building of the village was finished, they and the workmen melted away in
      the twilight.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>APTAIN Mason and I
      occupied the same hut, but we held no converse that night before falling
      into heavy slumber. Christopher insisted on sleeping outside the door. If
      any of our party had thought it prudent to appoint a watchman, no
      suggestion to that effect was made; but there was no knowing what
      responsibilities Christopher assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was looking over the great wall when we assembled for breakfast.
      Every one had a brighter appearance. I had never seen men so terribly
      cowed as these since the storms had beaten them down. The women had looked
      beyond the hopelessness, and had tried to sustain the courage of the
      colony. Every man was now beginning to hold up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the despair had melted from Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s face; it was clear
      that the lion in him was feebly straining. Mr. Rawley was recovering his
      aplomb. Annabel, having in her bearing an added depth and sweetness, had
      undoubtedly done much to accomplish that result with the two men, for
      there was something pathetic in the tenacity with which they clung to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the barkentine, before the elements became destructive, she had been
      aloof toward the other women and the children; but on the beach, at the
      feast, and on the weary march to the valley, she had given a cheering
      smile, word, or deed to those about. The promise thus made was meeting
      fulfilment this morning. She had assumed charge of the breakfast
      preparations, and, seeing that Christopher yearned to do kindly service,
      had made him her executive. I often caught her look of wonder at his
      unfailing intelligence, patience, and gentleness in doing her bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the men began to talk among themselves. Captain Mason went
      over and said something to Mr. Vancouver, who shook his head, and the
      captain returned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that the men are rousing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is time to organize. Mr.
      Vancouver declines to take the lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the one for that,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You have the military training and the tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have wisdom and a longer experience in discipline. Let&rsquo;s
      compromise. Take the leadership. I&rsquo;ll do your talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to caution you, but the others
      ought to know; these trees may have ears We need organization for
      defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a heartening address to the colony I called for the
      selection of a president. Mr. Vancouver named Captain Mason, who was
      elected. I was chosen his assistant, to Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s evident annoyance.
      Dr. Preston, a young physician, was made superintendent of the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men squared their shoulders; the women&rsquo;s faces brightened. In a few
      words I urged against any restlessness, any plotting,&mdash;anything, in
      fine, that would have the faintest color of mistrust or disobedience
      toward the king. &ldquo;Be patient. Hold together.&rdquo; That was the watchword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gato, the interpreter, soon appeared with a crowd of natives, and
      indicated that Christopher and I, with twenty picked men, should follow
      him. A short distance down the stream we came upon cleared land, and were
      given our first lesson in farming. Our men winced under this and the
      indefinite term of imprisonment which it implied. But the word was passed
      round: &ldquo;Wait. Be patient.&rdquo; The one hundred and fifty intelligent American
      men of us would find a way to match any ten thousand heathen under the
      sun. Blessed be the American brag! It is the front of something good
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson was concluded in the early afternoon, for the sun was growing
      hot. Gato led us down the stream a mile to a low ridge stretching across
      the valley. Not a break in the great wall enclosing the valley was
      visible, except the thin cleft which had given us ingress; but I reasoned
      that at the lower end there must be a gorge through which the stream
      issued, although no sign of it could be seen. Gato made us understand that
      this transverse ridge was the boundary of our freedom. He pointed out two
      landmarks springing from the walls and marking the terminals of the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one on the far side of the river was a barren bluff; opposite it, and
      forming part of the wall behind, there suddenly appeared a hideous
      caricature of a human face, a ferocious gargoyle, rudely fashioned by
      nature from the upper front of the cliff, protruding from the rock, and
      leering down horribly. It must have been a hundred feet from forelock to
      chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I withstood the shock badly, but was steadied by noting the deep
      satisfaction in Gato&rsquo;s eyes as he observed me. Unmistakably it was one of
      malignant triumph, instantly gone, but almost as disconcerting as the
      awful face itself. I felt that the ghastly apparition on the wall held a
      significance reaching the very depths of our fate. It was the embodiment
      of all the silent and implacable menaces hovering over the lethal fairness
      that environed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the blackish color of the rock, with reeking perpendicular streaks
      of green alternating with dull red. The forehead and chin receded in a
      simian angle; bulging eyes leered; below high cheek bones were mummy-like
      recessions, and hungry shadows filled them; the nose was flat, and the
      nostrils spread bestially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gato, informing us that his men would be on hand the next morning, took
      himself away. It gave a creepy sensation to note the snaky smoothness with
      which these men could sink out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our party started for camp. A heaviness sat on me, and I did not wish to
      talk. Christopher and I fell behind, and the others left us. I could not
      bear that any but Christopher should see my perturbation. Several times I
      glanced back to see the face on the wall. Its malignancy grew even more
      terrible through the hazing distance, and I was glad when the forest shut
      it out. If the spectacle affected me so deeply, what greater hold must it
      not have had on the natives? And there was the significant look that I had
      caught from Gato.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of the opposite wall I discovered near the edge what appeared to be
      a large stone table, or altar, and its position with reference to the face
      suggested a sinister purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the men were gone, hopelessness fell upon me. Never had anything
      like such heavy responsibilities crept into my life. A sense of my
      inadequacy grew unendurable; and, overcome by weariness of soul and body,
      I flung myself on the ground and buried my face in my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher presently stepped away with a sprightliness quite unusual, but
      I had not the spirit to look up. Even returning footsteps and a low murmur
      of voices failed to stir me. I was recalled by Christopher&rsquo;s quiet remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one to see you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat up, and discovered a native lad with him. His loose dress of blouse,
      trousers, and straw hat was of the commonest material. He was as unlike
      the native men as I had observed the fan-bearer to be, but his manner was
      shy and timid, lacking the careless defiance of hers. With a finger on his
      lips he beckoned us to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a secluded spot a little distance away, we sat down. My first surprise
      was when he began to talk. In a musical voice, he groped for words that I
      could understand, and in that way used a polyglot language, some words
      badly pronounced, and others spoken with surprising correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he enjoined secrecy, for should the king learn that he had come&mdash;&mdash;The
      lad finished with a grimace, and a swipe of the hand across his throat. He
      made me pledge the sun to burn me up, the moon to strike me a stark
      lunatic, and the stars to pierce me with their lances, should I betray his
      confidence,&mdash;all this solemnly, but with a twinkle in the back of his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, he was Beelo, brother of the king&rsquo;s fanbearer, Lentala, a good
      girl in a way, but&mdash;&mdash;A droll shake of his head left her in the
      air. Lentala and he were protégés of the king and queen, and enjoyed
      uncommon privileges, having been members of the king&rsquo;s household since
      childhood. The queen was very sweet and gentle, and they were fond of her.
      She had no children of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, third, Lentala wished Beelo to come surreptitiously to me in order to
      learn English. She had a special reason for that. Neither the king nor any
      of the other natives must know. That was all. Would I teach him, that he
      in turn might instruct her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversation, carried on in a mixture of languages, must be here given
      in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I will, and gladly, Beelo!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;but why not bring
      Lentala, that I may teach you together?&rdquo; I seized his hand in my joy of
      this heavensent opportunity. It was a small, delicate hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>can&rsquo;t</i> come,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;she&rsquo;s a girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she might come with you.&rdquo; I was pleased with the discovery that the
      savage girl had the fine instinct which establishes self-guarding and
      self-respecting conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distance is long. Girls have to wear skirts, you know, and girls are
      not as active as boys. Lentala, with her skirts, would be seen, and the
      king would find out. I can slip through anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded resignedly. Only with the greatest difficulty could I refrain
      from asking him many questions; but how did I know that he was not a spy?
      In establishing relations with him I was playing with every life in the
      colony. I observed Christopher. His air of listening to distant voices was
      not present, and I felt reassured for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo was anxious to begin; and he had his first lesson. Never had I found
      so eager and sweet-tempered a pupil, and his quickness was extraordinary.
      I drilled him first in the names of familiar objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he plumped at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tudor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tudor.&rdquo; He caught it with a snap, as though it were a ball. &ldquo;You have
      another name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began a comical struggle with the J, laboriously twisting his tongue
      and lips as he pronounced the first syllable <i>Cho</i> as the Chinese, <i>Yo</i>
      as the German, <i>Zho</i> as the French, and <i>Ho</i> as the Spanish; but
      the English eluded him, and he gave it up, laughing sweetly. Often during
      the lesson I saw in his handsome deep-blue eyes&mdash;which were maturer
      than the rest of him&mdash;a dash of the mischief, the teasing, and the
      challenge that gave Lentala her sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he demanded of Christopher, and pronounced it
      perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was gravely regarding the lad, who appeared disconcerted under
      the scrutiny. That disturbed me; but if the boy was seeking our undoing he
      would have to reckon with Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was curious about Annabel, and sent her affectionate messages from
      Lentala.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;where did you learn all those words from foreign
      languages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taken by surprise, he was confused and a little frightened, and had the
      look of a child preparing a fib.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people have been shipwrecked here,&rdquo; he answered, peering at me from
      under his brows. &ldquo;I learned from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head, and answered, &ldquo;The king said he sent them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you visit them secretly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;o.&rdquo; He began to play with twigs on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they herded in this valley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; His answer was firmer. &ldquo;There was never more than one or a very few
      at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat silent so long that he looked up, and showed alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the truth, lad,&rdquo; I insisted, holding his eyes. &ldquo;Where did you
      learn those words?&rdquo; A startling suspicion suddenly came. &ldquo;The gold in your
      hair, the blue in your eyes, the fine lines of your face,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to edge away, and I saw flight in him; but I caught his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the truth,&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at me in fear and pleading, but found no yielding, and with
      provoking indifference shrugged his shoulders and settled down with a
      pouting, martyr-like resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hurting my wrist,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; I demanded, tightening my grip. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t white blood mingled
      with some of the native blood here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips were compressed under the pain of my clasp, and an angry
      resentment steadied his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered, and a sudden change lit his face, as I unprisoned the
      wrist. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare me that way again,&rdquo; he said, half impudently shaking
      his head at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed best to desist from pressing the matter further, and pleasant
      relations were soon re-established between us; but the matter seated
      itself in a corner of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our lesson was delightful, and time escaped more smoothly than we knew.
      Beelo glanced at the sky, and sprang to his feet. He sweetly smiled his
      thanks, seized one of Christopher&rsquo;s great paws and vigorously shook it,
      asked me and Christopher to meet him at the same spot tomorrow at the same
      hour, and was darting away. I called him back, and led him to an opening
      through which the face on the cliff was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath, stood rigid, and slowly turned his face up to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That on the cliff? It is nothing&mdash;only stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;It sits there, it looks down threateningly on
      the valley; it says as plainly as speech&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Beelo, seizing my arm with both hands, and gazing up into
      my eyes. &ldquo;It is one of the gods. The people invoke it&mdash;you may see
      the altar fire on the opposite cliff some night when there is a great
      storm and the sea is raging. The god brings fish to the king&rsquo;s net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly, and with alarm clapped his palm to his mouth. I put
      my hand on his shoulder and smiled reassuringly. His manner grew composed,
      and he darted away and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to camp I told Captain Mason of the adventure. He was deeply
      interested, and sat in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve struck a lead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Follow it&mdash;cautiously.&rdquo;

      <i>Captain Mason Strengthens the Defense. The Extraordinary Behavior of
      Beelo. Christopher Becomes a Savage. Hidden Motives Half Disclosed. Hope.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ORSEEING the time
      when a visible danger would bring mob-madness to the colony, Captain Mason
      gave his entire attention to strengthening his control. To that end he
      kept every one engaged at something, laughed away all fears and doubts,
      placed all on honor not to breed discontent, and required that all
      discussions of the situation be with him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He impressed the danger of leaving the camp limits except in large parties
      organized under his authority. No spying savages were ever seen in the
      forest backing the camp, but I frequently found the captain using his keen
      eyes in that direction. The questions weighing on him were: When would the
      king ask for the first member of the colony to be sent away? What plan
      would be adopted in the selection? What would really become of the persons
      so taken? What should be done when the first call was made for
      deportation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher and I alone were in the president&rsquo;s confidence. On the second
      night he informed us that he had selected a spot which would serve as a
      fortress if occasion rose, and instructed Christopher in the art of making
      weapons, chiefly stone-headed clubs and blackjacks. This work was done
      secretly in our cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daily teaching of Beelo developed a new interest in the fact that,
      before I was aware, I was a pupil as well as a tutor, and that Beelo was
      as assiduous in instructing Christopher as me; he was evidently anxious
      that we should master the native language. I was glad to humor him,
      especially as I suspected an intelligent purpose. Above that was my
      growing affection for him. He perfected his poor English so rapidly that I
      was put on my mettle to learn the island tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple task, and we came to use it entirely. To my surprise,
      Christopher learned it as readily as I. From the very start he had helped
      Beelo to turn the teaching in that direction. The strangest element of all
      this procedure was the quick and sure understanding that sprang up between
      these two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo one day brought a large parcel. He was particularly happy, and as
      full of play as a kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t guess what I have for you,&rdquo; he said with a mischievous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Beelo&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; He was opening the parcel. &ldquo;You and Christopher are going to
      be Senatras.&rdquo; Senatra was the name of the inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced from the parcel two native costumes. In addition were a basin
      and some brown powder. The boy was in glee as he separated the articles
      into one array for Christopher and the other for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran to a little stream, fetched water in the basin, and with a comical
      seriousness dissolved part of the powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arm, Christopher,&rdquo; he demanded. At times Beelo&rsquo;s manner had a touch
      of imperiousness that sat oddly with his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher obediently bared his powerful arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Beelo in delight. &ldquo;You have splendid muscles,&mdash;they are
      like iron; and you are very strong,&mdash;that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; His finger was
      timid as it touched Christopher&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dipped a cloth in the colored water, and rubbed the stain on
      Christopher&rsquo;s white skin. His care and gravity in comparing the tint with
      the color of his own wrist, in shaking his head, in adding more pigment to
      the water and trying again, and at last his delighted satisfaction, were
      all very charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Senatra color. Now,&rdquo; addressing me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
      away a little while. You make a Senatra of Christopher.&rdquo; To Christopher:
      &ldquo;Take off everything. Mr. Tudor will put the color all over you. Then you
      put on Senatra clothes, and whistle for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Patient Christopher would doubtless submit to any indignity that this
      prankish boy might devise, but I proposed to put a stop to the nonsense.
      Besides, how could I assume the ridiculous rôle that this young scamp, in
      whom my indulgence had bred impudence, intended for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher will do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I peremptorily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad stopped short and looked at me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to, sir,&rdquo; Christopher interposed, much to my surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do? You wish to submit to this foolishness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolishness, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected a while, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it ain&rsquo;t jest foolishness, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I agreed, willing to humor him; &ldquo;But Beelo will stay here and
      put the color on you himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alarm sprang to the boy&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he answered defiantly, and was turning away, but I caught him
      by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped from my grasp and stood away, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to do it myself, sir,&rdquo; meekly said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo precipitately fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not play with these children? A man who would not was a churl. So
      Christopher was arrayed as a Senatra, and a whistle called Beelo back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He danced delightedly round the pitiful figure that Christopher made. It
      hurt me to see not only how patiently Christopher submitted, but how
      wholly he entered into the spirit of the masquerade. His pale eyes looked
      ghastly in his brown face. I called Beelo&rsquo;s attention to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that won&rsquo;t be seen at night!&rdquo; he exclaimed. The remark did not
      impress me at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put Christopher through numerous gaits and tricks of manner peculiar to
      the Senatras, and praised him for his aptness. Finally, when he taught his
      pupil the art of creeping stealthily and noiselessly, the man was so
      terrible that I forgot his grotesqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through this singular performance, Beelo, even though half playful,
      displayed astonishing perseverance and thoroughness, as if life itself
      depended on the perfection of the drill. That might not have looked so
      strange had it not been for the extraordinary care of Christopher himself
      to accomplish a perfect imitation. Then the significance of it all burst
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had vowed a thousand times since first knowing Christopher that never
      again would I underrate his wisdom, yet over and over I found myself doing
      so. While he never laughed in his romping with the children of the camp,
      but went into their sports with his habitual tender melancholy, he never
      showed with them the hidden eagerness, the almost desperate determination,
      that marked his training under Beelo. Thus I came to see that at the very
      beginning Christopher had discovered a vital meaning in Beelo&rsquo;s playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried Beelo, &ldquo;you will be a Senatra, Mr. Tudor! Christopher
      will dress you. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s eyes softened in a moment under the new light that he found in
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I said, taking his hand, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s sit down and talk.&rdquo; I seated
      myself, but he withdrew his hand and sat a little distance away. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
      gently insisted; &ldquo;here, facing me, and close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted himself round to the spot I indicated, and in doing so tossed
      Christopher a wry mouth. I noticed more clearly how fine his features
      were, and with what grace his long lashes curved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo, do you really wish Christopher and me to be Senatras?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and, turning to Christopher, told him to go to the runnel, wash
      off the stain and put on his own clothes. Christopher meekly went. Beelo
      began playing with twigs on the ground, and did not look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Lentala tell you to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded again&mdash;a little irritatingly, for he had a tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes and regarded me steadily. Then, perhaps not seeing all
      that he sought, he made no answer, and returned to the twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to understand, Beelo, and you must trust me. Many things come to
      me now. Your sister&rsquo;s conduct at the feast meant that she wished us to
      obey the king. She showed us sincere kindness in every look and act. And
      her great difference from the other people,&mdash;her sweetness, her
      grace, her beauty, her brightness of mind, her altogether adorable charm,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo blazed in a way that stopped my rhapsody. He had raised his face;
      his lips were apart; his eyes glowed with a proud light that moved me
      strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like my sister?&rdquo; he softly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you!</i>&rdquo; The boy impatiently tossed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little gesture was so pretty that I involuntarily smiled. Beelo
      misunderstood. He flashed angrily, and resumed the twigs. I could only
      grope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why the king sent us here. We are prisoners, and that
      is something which brave men won&rsquo;t stand. We would rather die fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he studied me, and again looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the king let us build boats, and leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave no answer, but was very busy with the twigs. I wondered if I were
      rash in some of the things I was saying. Clearly the moment of confidence
      had not arrived. The boy was studiedly cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo, go to your sister and beg her to come and see me. She will trust
      me more than you do. I know she is our friend. She would tell us what fate
      is awaiting us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; firmly interposed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would, because she is sweet and kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she loves her people, and you might do them harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she sends you here to disguise us as natives and to train us in the
      art of deceiving and outwitting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had his smile not been so winning I could have slapped him for his
      insolence; but it was soon evident that a mighty struggle was proceeding
      under his assumed carelessness. If I could only guess at its nature I
      might know how to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring Lentala to me, Beelo. She would be safe with you, and she will
      understand and will trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Her skin is brown. You would not trust her.&rdquo; He was closely
      observing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference can her color make!&rdquo; I impatiently retorted. &ldquo;Lentala is
      an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a brown skin means&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A look of horror swept over
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala is beautiful and kind and true. Tell her to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she not trust me?&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;How could I harm her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy, nervously arranging the twigs, spoke rapidly, but did not look
      up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid,&mdash;not for herself, but her people. They love her. She
      would never betray them. Suppose she came,&mdash;you would be gentle to
      her; you would tell her she was beautiful and&mdash;and all that nonsense.
      You might try to get her to tell you things. And you would find out how to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
      you might come back and plot with your men, and there would be a great
      fight with my people and many would be killed. That would be terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dimly understood at last: Lentala would trust her brother, not herself,
      in the mysterious plan that she was working out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had returned. I beckoned to him to sit with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;look at me.&rdquo; He complied. &ldquo;If Lentala were here she
      could read my heart. All that you have said means that she mistrusts me. I
      understand more than you think I do. You have already shown your
      confidence and Lentala&rsquo;s by offering to train me as a native. A wise and
      generous purpose is in that. By means of the disguise, you wish me to
      learn some things that will benefit my people, but you are held back by
      your fear that I will use the knowledge to injure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he hastily interrupted; &ldquo;only my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But you have already shown trust. You simply want more
      assurance that I will keep faith with you. Tell me what you want. I will
      put my life in pawn,&mdash;I will give it, if that is demanded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His deep eyes were profoundly fixed upon me. In that moment Beelo
      disclosed a soul that had found maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would do all for your people!&rdquo; he impatiently cried. &ldquo;You think only
      of them! Lentala and Beelo may do everything for you, but you never think
      what you might do for&mdash;Lentala and Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-revelation in the passionate outburst brought me to my feet, and
      the lad slowly came to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought it possible. You and she are the
      favorites of the king and queen. You have everything you want. I don&rsquo;t
      understand. Trust me! I can be a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking up at me with eyes in which a pathetic anxiety struggled
      with fears. Instead of addressing me, he turned to Christopher and
      confidently took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you like me&mdash;and Lentala?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher solemnly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if we want to go away with you and your people, would you take
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And be kind to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; He turned to me, and so did Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Christopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> will,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo, seized with one of his unexpected whirlwinds, threw his arms round
      Christopher, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned him about, and, holding both his hands, looked smilingly into his
      brilliant eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the way to serve you and your sister, Beelo,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I alone,
      or Christopher and I together, will obey any instructions from you; we
      will do whatever you say, go wherever you direct,&mdash;cut ourselves off
      from every protection except yours. Isn&rsquo;t our trust complete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yoseph&mdash;Choseph,&rdquo; he banteringly answered. Then, in a flash, &ldquo;I
      mean Mr. Tudor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph&mdash;to you,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his mouth through contortions over the F, and finally, with a
      restful gasp, blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gentleness overwhelmed me, and I, being naturally affectionate, and
      timid only with women, forgot my feeling of constraint toward him, and
      caught him in my arms. But he did not have for me the pressure and the
      laughter that he had given Christopher. On the contrary, he resisted and
      then sprang away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what thoughts were perplexing him as he stood off, regarding me
      in his odd little quizzical fashion, and was astounded when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala says that Annabel is beautiful and lovely.&rdquo; I could not imagine
      what had suggested Annabel to him at this particular moment, but I hastily
      agreed. He seemed not altogether pleased, but went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like her very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; very much indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little sullen, but soon recovered, and broke out in a very
      rush of gay spirits. In a short time he suddenly became grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said. With a gentle, pleading look at me, he asked: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      you be a Senatra? Christopher will help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Beelo,&mdash;anything you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I will come every day for&mdash;maybe three days, and teach
      Christopher. You will watch us. When you and Christopher are alone, he
      will teach you. But you must dress every time as a Senatra!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; My relief was great. For some incomprehensible reason I did
      not wish the boy to train me, for that would have necessitated a
      disagreeable loss of dignity before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! And in three or four days,&rdquo;&mdash;an oddly embarrassed expression
      rose in his face,&mdash;&ldquo;would you like to go with me&mdash;you and dear
      old Christopher&mdash;to see&mdash;the beautiful&mdash;the kind&mdash;the
      true&mdash;Lentala?&rdquo; He was mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I answered, and made an effort to catch him; but he darted away,
      showering a cascade of laughter behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was right in supposing that Beelo had been preparing us to penetrate
      the mysteries beyond the valley ramparts, and lift the veil behind which
      our fate was hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; I cried in my joy, seizing him by the shoulder; &ldquo;do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;The Opening of a Pit.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Insolence and Rebellion in Camp. A Riot Averted. I Train for a
      Dangerous Rôle. Plotting Among Us for the Destruction of the Colony.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Christopher
      began my training and pursued it with such amazing thoroughness, my
      feeling of being ridiculous disappeared. My love of adventure in these
      preparations was mingled with other emotions,&mdash;the fascination of
      hazard, a ===wish to risk everything for the colony, and a strong desire
      to see Lentala and solve the mystery of her whole conduct. Beelo was a
      will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complications arose in camp. Although I had taken care to exercise my
      authority in a bland way, it became necessary at times to be severe. My
      greatest difficulty was inability to find the source of a disaffection
      working insidiously among the young men. Captain Mason had not observed
      it, lacking my opportunity, and I decided to be more positive and to find
      evidence before laying the matter before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was intimately thrown with the men by directing the work on the farm.
      The labor was exhausting on account of the heat. For this reason, and
      because some men could bear the work better than others, and liked it, I
      called out only volunteers; but selfishness on the part of some who
      shirked brought grumbling. At first I had supposed that this was the
      origin of the dissatisfaction, but presently a deeper cause appeared to be
      in operation. As a test, and to secure fairness, I adopted a system of
      levying on all the able-bodied men and requiring each to do his share in
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that way I came down on Rawley, who had never volunteered. When I
      informed him one evening that his turn in the fields would come next day,
      he stared at me in insolent silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That incident alone was not significant, but it made me alert, and I
      instructed Christopher to keep a strict and secret watch on the camp. A
      present necessity was to force the issue with Rawley, whose bearing was a
      threat to the harmony and safety of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not taken the trouble to absent himself from the tables when I
      called out the tale of men for the fields next morning, but lounged at
      indolent unconcern. Annabel was not visible. Mr. Vancouver, sitting near
      Rawley, had a suspiciously waiting air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not rise with the others and prepare to go, but merely
      stared at me. I went near and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men will resent your refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you threatening me?&rdquo; he said under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give my remark whatever construction you please,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not hide his anger and fear, for a glance showed him a
      disquieting expression in the faces of the forty men waiting. Mr.
      Vancouver looked surprised and irritated as he studied them. The men in
      whom rebellion was stirring were such as he had always directed and
      commanded,&mdash;artisans, mechanics, clerks, sturdy and spirited every
      one, and loving fair play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save yourself further trouble,&rdquo; Rawley drawled in an effort to be
      nonchalant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;if I feel like it, and when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the men could not hear him, they understood, and a murmur arose.
      One of them angrily said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too good to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him under arrest! Duck him in the river! The snob!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel suddenly appeared. The men at once desisted, and she understood
      the situation at a glance. Her astonishment grew as her look of angry
      reproach at Rawley passed to her father and found him silent and pale, as
      though for the first time he had seen the spirit of the common American.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make trouble now. Be patient. You can find
      a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I must remind you that you have not been empowered
      by the colony to enforce its discipline. In this instance it is my task
      alone, and I propose to handle it as I think best, without your
      assistance, unless I call on you for it. Your attitude and remarks just
      now were rebellious, and, if allowed by those in authority, would disrupt
      us and place us at the mercy of savages. Leave this matter to me, and
      depend on me to see it properly adjusted. Mr. Vancouver needs Mr. Rawley
      today. Now to our work.&rdquo; My speech affected the men in two quite different
      ways. Some, with a submissive glance at Mr. Vancouver who was watching me
      curiously, were instantly satisfied; others looked a little confused and
      rebellious, and were not cheerful in their obedience. They appeared a
      trifle uneasy, as though something might be afoot and they had not been
      informed. All of this sharpened my alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the day&rsquo;s work I had doubts as to whether I should report the
      incident to Captain Mason, who had not been present. I felt that something
      of an underground nature was at work, and that Mr. Vancouver was its
      focus. I could make allowance for a man shattered by adversity, but I
      supposed that Mr. Vancouver might have gathered himself up during the
      weeks we had been held as prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that he had. When Christopher came to give me my drill in
      the forest near the camp that day he brought disturbing information. Mr.
      Vancouver and Rawley, in order to be alone, had gone into the forest after
      I left for the fields, and talked. All that Christopher could learn was
      that Mr. Vancouver was carrying on secret negotiations with the king, and
      that a messenger from the palace was expected at a certain place within
      the forest in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lesson was short that day. I sent Christopher to Captain Mason to
      report what he had heard, and to say that I would take the place of the
      native in the interview, if possible, trusting to the completeness of my
      disguise as a Senatra. Christopher was to be near for an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skirting the spot where Mr. Vancouver was to meet the native, I
      intercepted him. It sickened me to see the sly confidence with which he
      approached. Meanwhile, I was aware of the great danger of discovery by the
      genuine messenger, for I knew the trailing skill of the natives, even
      though I led Mr. Vancouver as far from the meeting-place as necessary. But
      Christopher, who had acquired the native slyness, would know how to handle
      any embarrassing situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s seeming treachery had so disturbed me
      that I had some doubt of myself in the interview. The simple solution
      offered by strangling the man in the forest kept hammering at me with a
      dangerous persistency. We had taken it for granted that his interest in
      the colony was strong; no watch had been set on his liberty, which he had
      used in plotting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was measurably collected by the time we had seated ourselves on the
      ground. Being totally in the dark as to what had gone before, I was forced
      to extreme caution, and in addition was some danger of my betraying myself
      or of his discovering that I was not a native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the other man come?&rdquo; he demanded in his old peremptory manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In confusion, not knowing what degree of proficiency in English to assume,
      I gave some answer in a lame speech, the inconsistency of which he might
      have detected had he been less absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the king&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to know yours first,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was prepared for his quick, half-suspicious look. &ldquo;He knows what I
      want,&rdquo; was the sharp return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other native didn&rsquo;t know. He couldn&rsquo;t tell the king very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my plan,&rdquo; went on Mr. Vancouver: &ldquo;I make some good, strong men
      think that Captain Mason does nothing, but sits down and waits for us all
      to be killed. This is secret. A fellow named Hobart is my leader. The
      young men are ready to go with him out of the valley. The king will tell
      the guard to seize them and take them to the palace. That will get rid of
      the best fighters in the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will the young men think they go for?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make,&rdquo; he testily demanded, &ldquo;so long as they
      are out of the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king must know.&rdquo; I was solid and firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make them think they can pass the guard; then they&rsquo;ll find a way for
      the colony to escape, and will come back and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver was silent, and his impatience grew. &ldquo;You will send them
      into a trap?&rdquo; I persisted. Again his suspicious scrutiny. &ldquo;Does the king
      want them to come back?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But he wants your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t come back,&rdquo; Mr. Vancouver explained, &ldquo;Captain Mason will be
      blamed for not knowing they were to go. Then his power will be gone. The
      colony will break up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ghastly perfection of the scheme overcame me for a moment, but I must
      learn what benefits Mr. Vancouver expected from this wholesale sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I and my daughter and a young man named Rawley are to be taken care of,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean not killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He writhed and reddened under the question, and under my sullen
      insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, he hurried on: &ldquo;I will show the king how to work the
      gold, silver, copper, diamond, and other mines, and how to make much money
      out of them. I will make treaties with other countries, and build forts,
      and make him a strong army. All this has to be done sooner or later, or
      the island will be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with the other white people?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t tell him he&rsquo;ll send me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a struggle with his anger, Mr. Vancouver said, &ldquo;The king knows what
      he has done with other castaways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think he has done with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started at me in a struggle with his patience, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they were sent away?&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fury broke. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and then suddenly checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think they are here yet?&rdquo; I drove in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose in a passion. &ldquo;Tell the king to send me a man who isn&rsquo;t a fool!&rdquo;
       he stormed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him,&rdquo; I quietly said, rising and starting away; but he halted
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask those questions?&rdquo; he said more composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king told me to. He wants to know if he can trust you. If you want
      these people sent away,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t! That would ruin everything. They&rsquo;d send armies and war-ships,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, kept here&mdash;alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! They&rsquo;d kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had known this to be the answer that I would wring from him; still the
      renewed impulse to strangle him was almost overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell the king,&rdquo; I duly said, and was turning away, when another
      idea came. &ldquo;Maybe he will first send for a man from your people. Which one
      do you want to go before the young men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tudor, Captain Mason&rsquo;s assistant,&rdquo; he answered with a vicious promptness.
      &ldquo;Then, as soon as the young men are gone, I and my daughter and Rawley
      will go, and I will talk and plan with the king while the soldiers do
      their work here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The humor that I found in the turn, personal to me, which the situation
      had taken, lightened my spirit, and I thought of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the king send you any word about Lentala, his fan-bearer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked with the man about her. I knew there was some mystery about her
      and that she was close to the king. I asked that she be sent to make the
      plans with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His halt whetted my anxiety. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she must know nothing about it, or she would break the plot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart choked me with its bounding. I had gained more than I had lost,
      but my heart was sore for Annabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Next time I come I will go to your hut in the night.
      Don&rsquo;t come into these woods again. The soldiers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood, and looked relieved. After he had disappeared I sat down in
      a daze, trying to reason out the tangle. Rawley was in the plot, but
      Annabel was innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound made me raise my head, and I saw Christopher and Captain Mason
      standing before me. Christopher&rsquo;s face wore its customary vacancy, but
      Captain Mason&rsquo;s had a startled look, as though he had beheld what is not
      good for a man to see. It appeared to have shriveled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Christopher summoned me,&rdquo; he dully said without any preliminary,
      &ldquo;he found the native and sent him away. We have heard every word that
      passed between you and Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;Witcheries in Hand.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A Dangerous Mood. Annabel&rsquo;s Tangled Situation. Heroism in Humble
      Duties. The Miracle Worked by Gentleness. Traitors Are Threatened.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT a word was
      spoken after I had dressed and we were returning to camp, but Captain
      Mason&rsquo;s walk lacked its usual firmness. What would he do? There is no
      accounting for the rashness of a man made suddenly desperate, and I
      remembered the temptation to strangle that had assailed me. Clearly, for
      the present, Christopher and I must not leave him alone for a moment. My
      imagination constructed this scene: Captain Mason, assembling the colony,
      telling them briefly that a man among them had been caught in the act of
      plotting to destroy us, turning upon Mr. Vancouver and pointing him out as
      the criminal, ordering me to tell off a squad and hang the knave in the
      presence of the crowd; and Annabel&mdash;&mdash;Could Christopher and I
      stay the flood now while the dam was straining? I feared not; a finer hand
      was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to our hut. Captain Mason seated himself on a stool. Christopher
      gave him some water, which was eagerly drunk. With a significant look at
      Christopher, I left the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good excuse for bringing Annabel now; I had promised Beelo
      that he should see her. It was necessary to secure Captain Mason&rsquo;s assent,
      and I had no doubt that he would agree with me that a friendship between
      her and Lentala might go farther toward solving our problems than all our
      masculine wit and fighting ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reflected on the extraordinary complications in which Annabel would be
      involved, and the softening pressure which she would assist in bringing
      upon Captain Mason. There was no immediate danger from Mr. Vancouver. He
      lay snugly in the hollow of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel was busy about the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Christopher?&rdquo; she cheerily asked. &ldquo;It is time for him to make
      the fire for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason has him,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me and call on
      our president?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush mottled her cheeks, but she hesitated only a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t care, I know,&rdquo; she said, and started with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bareheaded, and the witcheries of the twilight drifted over her.
      In the distance sang the deep monotone of the waterfall. Drowsy
      twitterings announced that the busy little people of the trees were
      content after their day&rsquo;s work. From the edges of the stream rose
      comfortable whispers between the water and the reeds. The lightly moving
      air swung odorous censers in the trees, and every flower poured out as
      perfume the sunshine which had filled its chalice. It was good to be thus
      again side by side with Annabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained tomorrow&rsquo;s plan for her meeting with Beelo, and impressed upon
      her the importance of keeping it secret. She showed the glee of a quiet
      child in her acquiescence, but she must have wondered why her father was
      not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An adventure!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And mystery! It is delightful. Do you men
      with so much freedom know how depressing it is to be cooped up in this
      camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not thought of it, and was surprised. Annabel had always been
      cheerful, and I had not observed the other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it life,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;for men to work and women to wait, for men to
      dare and women to endure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, looking up at me with a smile, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t it a
      remnant of savagery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Yet Lentala, the savage, appears in her
      independence to have solved some latter-day feminine problems. I hope you
      will meet her soon. Then you and she can formulate a code for your sex. We
      are going to see Captain Mason in order to secure his consent to your
      meeting her brother. So you must exercise your subtlest graces on our
      president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid of him,&rdquo; she declared in some trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is stern and silent and cold and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all on the surface. His sea-training has given it to him.
      Underneath he has a woman&rsquo;s gentleness and kindness. Trust him. Look for
      the best in him and ignore the rest. Just now he is worried and needs all
      the sunshine that you know so well how to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled her thanks, but there was concern in her question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worried! Has anything special happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was anything special needed? His responsibilities are great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel was silent,&mdash;not daring, I know, to ask more questions. She
      had unfolded to my comprehension what the women of our party had been
      suffering patiently and silently during the dreary weeks that they had
      been held in prison. Annabel must have borne more than any other; yet she
      had held up her heart and her head. Dread must have sat on her pillow
      through many a long hour of the night, but her soul walked forth with the
      sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was sitting on a bench outside the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the fire isn&rsquo;t made yet;&rdquo; but there was no
      chiding in her rosy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answered, rising, but standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and make it now, please,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked, low.
    </p>
    <p>
      His slow nod held a doubt. There was always in Christopher&rsquo;s manner a
      suggestion that speech was largely a silly indulgence, and that animals
      other than human beings made themselves intelligible without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fetched a delicious drink which he had made from wild fruit, and served
      Annabel with quite an air. Her voice carried music in its thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel bubbled with raillery and chatter. Presently my anxious ear heard
      a stir within. I knew that the man nursing his hurt in the dusk was aware
      of the invasion, and that he understood and resented my ruse in bringing
      Annabel to disarm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; she said, handing him the calabash from which she had
      drunk, &ldquo;please go and make the fire and start the supper. After that, find
      father; ask him to come here for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher mutely interrogated me, and I nodded. He shambled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out and join us, Captain Mason!&rdquo; I called.
    </p>
    <p>
      It left him no choice. The darkness kindly falling veiled the grayness of
      his face. A touch of decrepitude lay on him as he stepped without and
      greeted Annabel with a stiff and stately courtesy, for he was shy with
      women of the higher world. The unsteadiness in his manner surprised
      Annabel, whose sympathies were keen and quick. I had prepared her, and,
      shocked though she evidently was, she met the situation bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some general talk, which was directed by me to show Annabel&rsquo;s
      suffering, her courage and helpfulness, I saw that Captain Mason was
      softened. I then placed before him the plan concerning Annabel and Beelo.
      It took the breath out of his body, and he peered at me in amazement
      through the gloom. The perfect assurance with which I asked for his
      concurrence, a hint that her discretion might be trusted, and a casual
      remark that Christopher approved the idea, had effect. Annabel impulsively
      rose, seized both his hands, and pleaded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me go, Captain Mason. Who knows what good may not come of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think she noticed the catch in his throat. It was the final
      breaking up of the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may go. But you&rsquo;ll do nothing except as Mr. Tudor approves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever, Captain Mason. Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released his hands and turned a beaming face to me. Pity for her
      welled within me. That she and her father, between whom there was so
      strong an attachment, should thus secretly proceed in opposite directions,
      each deceiving the other, was a terrible thing. No human perception could
      foresee the outcome, and, it gave me an uneasiness that she must have
      dimly seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look glad!&rdquo; she said in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too happy for mere gladness, my friend,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and may all the
      good angels help you&mdash;and shield you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard the note of solemnity, and turned to Captain Mason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is our situation so serious?&rdquo; she asked him, a slight quaver in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life can have no serious dangers for so brave a heart as yours,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver came up. I could feel a tigerish stealth in him. All danger
      from an immediate clash between him and Captain Mason had been banished by
      Annabel, but I knew that the future held dangers. I was glad that she and
      I had become partners in the secrets and exactions of defense. With such
      an ally as Christopher, and such a director as Captain Mason, we would
      give an account of ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain hardened when Mr. Vancouver came. That gentleman playfully
      scolded Annabel for running away, and was somewhat too affable toward the
      silent, unresponsive sailor. Soon he tucked Annabel&rsquo;s hand under his arm
      and was leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a word, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; said Captain Mason in a tone that stopped my
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I unintentionally witnessed a scene this morning that I didn&rsquo;t like. I
      wish you to hear the order that I&rsquo;ll give Mr. Tudor.&rdquo; His voice was
      ominously quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tudor,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;order Rawley to fall in with the field squad
      tomorrow. If he shows the slightest hesitation, clap him in irons and send
      for me. There&rsquo;s a rope for the neck of any man who undermines the
      discipline of this colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel started, and reeled where she stood. Her father&rsquo;s nostrils were
      spreading with a sneering smile; but, seeing her state, he seized her arm,
      steadied her with a word, and in silence led her away.

      <i>The Strange Meeting of Annabel and Beelo. Captain Mason&rsquo;s Cruel
      Decision. I Tell a Romantic Story and Make a Guess at Lentala&rsquo;s Origin.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>APTAIN MASON and I
      had a serious talk in our hut that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think for a moment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my intentions with regard to
      Vancouver have been upset by a woman&rsquo;s pretty face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is very lovely,&rdquo; I interposed, anxious to turn his thoughts from
      whatever purpose he might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as one thinks.&rdquo; I could not restrain a smile at his
      ungraciousness, particularly as I saw that Annabel&rsquo;s effect on him had
      impaired his frankness. &ldquo;For that matter,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;her father is
      blindly planning her destruction.&rdquo; In answer to my look he explained: &ldquo;How
      can a man let his avarice and cowardice make such a fool of him! Can&rsquo;t he
      see that the king is using him as a tool to disrupt and destroy the camp,
      including him and his party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew, as well as I knew my own thoughts, that a terrible apprehension of
      a fate worse than death for us all rested on him, as on me; but we had
      dared not give it tongue. Both had seen the naïve inconsistency between
      the king&rsquo;s desire that the island should not be discovered and his promise
      to send us away one at a time, and so had Mr. Vancouver. No foreigner
      straying to the island had ever left it, and none except our colony was
      alive on it today. But in what dreadful manner had they been disposed of?
      And why had we been spared so long? We had been prisoners nearly two
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether these fears and speculations haunted others of the colony we were
      both careful not to inquire, and were prompt in suppressing every
      uncomfortable hint. Captain Mason and I understood that the perfect
      cohesion of our colony, taken with our considerable numbers, offered the
      sole hope for our safety; and Mr. Vancouver was secretly planning to
      destroy our one means of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been sitting in silence after Captain Mason&rsquo;s last speech. He broke
      it by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation is complex. Your interruption of Vancouver&rsquo;s plot and
      Christopher&rsquo;s dismissal of the native require us to lay a counter train.
      The king will infer from what Christopher told the native that Mr.
      Vancouver has abandoned his scheme to betray the colony, and that we are
      determined to hang together, and fight it out to the end. I imagine that
      the natives are growing impatient for a victim. What do you suggest, Mr.
      Tudor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I should continue in the rôle of the king&rsquo;s emissary and inform
      Mr. Vancouver that the sending out of the young men is postponed.
      Fortunately we have stopped that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done nothing of the sort,&rdquo; declared the president. &ldquo;They shall go
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment silenced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall go out,&rdquo; he drove into me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To their destruction&mdash;and ours?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But they must go and take their punishment. Then they will hear from
      me. You can manage it through the native boy and his sister. Let her see
      that they are soundly whipped and sent back to the colony. She&rsquo;s our
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is unthinkable,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;The risk is too great. Lentala can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate her. You have your instructions, sir.&rdquo; He rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be on hand tomorrow when you call out the men for the fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had risen, and stood facing a commander instead of an ally. After a
      moment&rsquo;s struggle with desperately rebellious emotions, I saw my own
      absurdity, and abruptly left without a word, to fight for patience and
      wisdom under the stars.

    <p>
      The smiling ease with which Rawley stepped forth when I called his name
      with the others next morning might have disarmed me had I not caught a
      look of understanding between him and Mr. Vancouver, and known what it
      meant. My dread had been on Annabel&rsquo;s account, but she did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rawley worked faithfully in the fields that day, but I saw the furtive way
      in which he talked now and then with certain of the men, and I noted all
      whom he thus favored. None of them had a guilty manner, though a
      concealing one. It was evidence of Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s shrewdness in plotting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel met Christopher outside the camp that afternoon and came with him
      to Beelo and me. The boy betrayed a singular uneasiness as they
      approached, and, drawing his hat down, stood in awkward embarrassment. It
      puzzled me, for he had been anxious to see her. In a glow of excitement,
      Annabel was conspicuously handsome, and though dressed in the rougher of
      the two suits which she had saved from the wreck, showed in every line the
      thoroughbred that she was. Seeing the lad&rsquo;s confusion, she spared him by
      giving him hardly more than a smiling glance with her warm hand-clasp, and
      breezily said to me as she held out an exquisite orchid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what I found on the way. Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo; I took it and was
      fumbling to put it in the buttonhole of my lapel, when she stepped up and
      with frank comradeship adjusted it, remarking as she did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very much like his sister, but smaller, and not so pretty and
      graceful.&rdquo; She did not realize that he understood English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you&mdash;for Lentala,&rdquo; he constrainedly said, staring at her as
      his eyes began to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Annabel in amused surprise. &ldquo;But you are quite too
      good-looking for a boy, Beelo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not smile, but studied her with a disconcerting seriousness, and
      looked from her to me, as though watching for something which I guessed to
      be a sly understanding between Annabel and me that might mean ridicule of
      him. I saw that Annabel had innocently blundered into a wrong start.
      Evidently the pleasure that the lad had expected from the meeting had gone
      astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though the words were wrenched from him by the striking picture that
      Annabel made, he said in a stolid, colorless voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are more beautiful than Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear his disloyalty to his sister!&rdquo; laughingly exclaimed Annabel, but I
      could see that the boy&rsquo;s bearing was trying her composure. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she
      added; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be friends, for Lentala and I are, and I want you to tell me
      about her.&rdquo; She coaxingly held out her hand as to an ill-tempered child.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he ignored it, and lowered his head till his hat-rim concealed his
      eyes. Annabel looked at me in questioning surprise, but before I could say
      anything,&mdash;being as much astonished as she,&mdash;Beelo, without
      raising his head, asked half sullenly, half commandingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you and&mdash;Choseph known each other a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year or so,&rdquo; Annabel promptly answered, anxious to show her
      friendliness. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been very kind. I became a skilful horsewoman under
      his teaching, and we&rsquo;ve danced together and taken long walks in the
      country. He knows a great many interesting things. You see, he was
      educated at West Point, where young men are trained to be officers of our
      army, and has fought in the war, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo broke in with a toss of the head and a laugh that sounded much like
      a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel opened her eyes and looked in wonder from the boy to me. She was
      not laughing now; alarm was creeping into her face. I could think of
      nothing to say, but was confident that the two fine souls would find a
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without raising his face to Annabel, Beelo slowly looked round at me, and
      regarded me deeply and in silence. Sadness stole into his eyes, and with
      it reproach. The mystery of it touched me as I steadily returned his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did not speak, I did. &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I kindly said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
      you, and I don&rsquo;t like your conduct. You wished to see Annabel. To please
      me, she kindly took the trouble to come and tried to be friendly to you.
      But you treat her rudely. You are not worthy to touch her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blazed and went rigid. For a moment he was choked with passion; then,
      locking his hands behind him, and throwing back his head and shoulders, he
      said loudly, while his nostrils quivered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not worthy to touch her hand! I&rsquo;m glad of it! You send fine words
      to Lentala, who has not a white friend in the world! Then you bring the
      white girl to Beelo, that Beelo may see how different they are and go back
      to shame Lentala. Riding! Dancing! Walking! Ah, Beelo is a little fool,&mdash;a
      fool no bigger that a toad! But he can be useful,&mdash;he can make
      Lentala a fool too! And Lentala can be useful. She can trick King Rangan.
      She shall be the tool of the white people who want to leave!&rdquo; He paused
      breathless, but there was more of despair than anger in his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel had gone very white. She gave me a glance of new amazement, and
      then went forward, seized Beelo&rsquo;s arm, and forcibly turned him to look
      into her eyes. With a start she straightened, looking at me strangely, as
      if a great light had broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a misunderstanding,&rdquo; she calmly said to Beelo and me as she
      apologetically held the quivering figure. To me she added: &ldquo;You and
      Christopher please retire. I&rsquo;ll call you soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left, and when screened and beyond earshot I gave Christopher a look of
      wondering inquiry. He blinked benignly at me, as a dog at his foolish
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are asking me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked away, but not with a listening manner, yet the mystery appeared
      to demand it. I did not happen to remember that he was the most chivalrous
      and the least meddlesome man I had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir,&rdquo; he presently said in his slow, gentle way; &ldquo;it
      will be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it apparently was when Annabel called us back, for the two were
      chatting amicably as they sat on the ground. Annabel&rsquo;s serious mistake, by
      which she had imperiled my plans, had been turned by her to excellent
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher was waiting to conduct her back to camp; he would return, for
      Beelo had informed me that there were matters which he wished to tell us
      alone. The parting between him and Annabel was friendly and held promise,
      but Beelo&rsquo;s face was not wholly unclouded. Holding Annabel&rsquo;s hand and
      gazing into her face, he said, with a touch of sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody would love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel blushed, and turned laughingly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again very soon!&rdquo; called the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel turned and blew him a smiling kiss. The lad stood and gazed long
      at the spot where she was lost among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like her, Beelo?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to my surprise, a little droop pulled at his mouth-corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very lovely,&rdquo; he softly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a thing to be sad about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Lentala can never be as sweet and beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as sweet and beautiful as Annabel, and&mdash;and&mdash;what shall
      I say?&mdash;more fascinating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was turned away, and he was silent. After a while he faced me,
      and said, while observing me closely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she belongs to your kind, your world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart finds my kind, and that is my world.&rdquo; He again turned away. In
      trying to find a reason why any of this mattered to him, or why he
      appeared in a measure to resent Annabel, the old suspicion that had lodged
      in a corner of my mind came forth. The remarkable difference between
      Lentala and her brother on one hand and the natives on the other must have
      some special explanation, and Beelo must have a secret which he had a good
      reason for guarding. Christopher and I had probably been the only white
      men to touch their lives, and there was in them that which knew and
      claimed its own. It was a hungry demand, and jealous. To see the desired
      companionship subject to an older claim, such as Annabel&rsquo;s, was the
      finding of a barrier. I determined to probe for the secret by indirect
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soul that finds its kind finds its world, Beelo,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and souls
      have neither race nor color. Would you like to hear a strange little
      story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he eagerly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down, and he seated himself facing me, keenly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time ago a white man&mdash;a gentleman, no doubt&mdash;was in a
      ship that was sailing the seas. A great storm came on. His ship was
      wrecked, and he was cast up on the beach of a beautiful tropical island.
      It was decreed by the natives, who were jealous for their country, that he
      should suffer the fate of all who had drifted before him to those shores.
      But for some reason&mdash;that may be another story some time&mdash;he was
      spared, and the king gave him a wife from among the native girls. Two
      children were born to them, a girl and afterward a boy; but their father
      had so strongly impressed his racial peculiarities on them that they were
      in an unfortunate position,&mdash;outcasts in a way, and perhaps in danger
      of their lives, by reason of the deeply planted native hatred for the
      white blood. So the king, who had spared the man, took them under his
      protection, and as the queen had no children, she loved them as her own.
      But in time, as the children grew up, the white blood in them began to
      starve for its kind, and to whisper of a far country whence it had come.
      That is nature&rsquo;s way. She lets us go just so far from the plan on which
      she started us, and then she sends a voice that speaks deep within us. We
      may not know at first what it says, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a longing?&rdquo; Beelo asked
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely that. We want something very much, but don&rsquo;t know what it is. We
      are dissatisfied. That comes in youth, when the tides of life flow free,
      and before the soul is fully awake. Afterward, when it has ripened and
      mellowed, it finds its kind and makes its home wherever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while. But now!&rdquo; demanded Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ignored him with a smile, and went back to the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last the sister had grown to womanhood and the brother nearly to
      manhood. A much larger company of white people than had ever before been
      stranded on the island came to its shores. The girl and the boy had been
      spoiled by the king, and they had much their own way. The girl demanded
      that she be taken with the king to see the castaways. It was the voice in
      her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo nodded, and then with nervous fingers began to weave a twig-house on
      the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the story?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up in surprise. &ldquo;Is that all, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that sufficient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;She went there just to <i>see</i> them?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled into his brilliant eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest of the story
      some other time,&rdquo; I remarked, satisfied, because at not a single point had
      he criticized my guessing. &ldquo;There is one thing more,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Of
      course the children adopted the native dress, but their father&rsquo;s blood in
      them had lightened their native color, and that must be overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes kindled brighter; his lips had fallen apart. There was not a
      movement in his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lad, how did you learn to stain a fair skin so well that it looks like a
      native&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that I seized the collar of his blouse, to tear it open and see the
      real color of his chest before he could prevent.

    </p>
    <p>
      A gurgling laugh raised my head. Twenty feet away, in a direction opposite
      to that in which Beelo had disappeared, I saw him lying on the ground,
      kicking up his heels, and, his cheeks resting in his hands, mischievously
      laughing at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t gone?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Christopher will come soon, and I have
      something to say to you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, came forward gingerly, and halted a safe distance away. I
      sometimes wondered whether any other man would have borne with him at all.
      The wretch knew that I had grown absurdly fond of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to tell me?&rdquo; he asked, as he crept nearer and
      contemptuously regarded my hutbuilding effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words I frankly told him of my experience as a Senatra with Mr.
      Vancouver. He listened absorbed and aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;I am glad you told me. You do trust me,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you, Beelo? Have I ever failed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you are always thinking of your people, never of Lentala and
      Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taught me to think of you and Lentala, else I never would have
      told you about Mr. Vancouver and his plot. But don&rsquo;t you see? The king is
      using Mr. Vancouver to break up our colony, Beelo,&rdquo; raising myself in
      aggressive earnestness. &ldquo;You talk of my trusting you. I have already put
      my life and more than two hundred other lives in your hands. But not for
      one moment have you ever trusted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was deep in thought, and was distressed. Before I could ask him for the
      cause, Christopher came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is going to happen very soon,&rdquo; Beelo said. &ldquo;Christopher, what
      did you say to the native that came to see Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher wore his stupidest manner Beelo reached round, picked up a
      stick and threatened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I said. Now answer&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; mocked Beelo, and struck him. The nearest that I had ever seen to a
      smile on Christopher&rsquo;s face came then as a twinkle in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I told him Mr. Vancouver didn&rsquo;t never want
      to see him no more.&rdquo; That was a long speech for Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo; impatiently demanded Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done this a-way at him.&rdquo; Christopher crossed his eyes and made a
      grimace at Beelo. The act was so unexpected and terrifying that Beelo
      started back in alarm, and then rolled on the ground in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up. &ldquo;What did the man do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This a-way.&rdquo; Christopher&rsquo;s face assumed a look of astonishment and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He runned away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo nodded thoughtfully, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will think Mr. Vancouver changed his mind. Very well. Now he
      won&rsquo;t wait any longer. He will make a demand for one of your people.&rdquo; His
      manner was grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised when I informed him of Captain Mason&rsquo;s determination that
      the young men be permitted to leave the valley, and that Lentala should
      arrange for their being turned back,&mdash;I had no heart to say anything
      about their rough handling by the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think she can manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure?&rdquo; I anxiously demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Choseph. You are too serious to be happy. Let&rsquo;s talk about
      the first man to go out when the king sends for one. Do you wish Mr.
      Vancouver to go?&rdquo; The question came with a keen look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it will expose him to any danger, or give him an opportunity to
      plot against us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo&rsquo;s look became suspicious. &ldquo;What do you owe him, that he is not to be
      exposed to danger?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the trend of his question, I was irritated, and sternly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my affair, and I won&rsquo;t discuss it. If there&rsquo;s to be anything
      petty and spiteful in the matters of life and death that we are planning,
      I will stop everything right here, or demand that Lentala send some one
      else to me if it is impossible for her to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo was staring at me in surprise. He turned inquiringly to Christopher,
      and saw gentler but none the less reproving eyes. For a second he
      floundered between resentment and irrepressible good-nature, and then with
      a laugh threw a handful of sand at Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything, really I didn&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;ll be
      good.&rdquo; After reflection he asked, &ldquo;Who is Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s best friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man named Rawley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he knows Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let him be the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darkness crouched behind all of this, but Beelo&rsquo;s intelligent eyes were a
      light ahead. Unquestionably his mind was working rapidly, but his speech
      was slow and had silent intervals. He and Lentala were evidently
      undertaking severe tasks and desperate risks the nature of which I could
      not even surmise. Some profound motive must be urging them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is taken out of the valley,&rdquo; Beelo said after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want
      you and Christopher to go too, with me. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do anything you wish, Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As natives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul is to know but your captain. Not Annabel, mind you!&rdquo; he
      abruptly added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you both promise that if your lives are threatened, you will try not
      to hurt or kill any one except as a last resort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Beelo, &ldquo;I want Christopher to go with me at once, and we&rsquo;ll
      make a raft. When we go out of the valley it will be by way of the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all fully agreed to, dear little brother,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;but
      some things must be understood. The first is that no harm shall befall any
      man taken out of the valley by the king&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me, Choseph,&rdquo; he replied, looking hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more than you trust me,&rdquo; I kindly but emphatically said. &ldquo;While I
      know that wisdom and a noble purpose are in your and Lentala&rsquo;s every plan
      and act, I have heavy responsibilities, and I know that four heads would
      be better than two in this matter. I have no right to go ahead in the
      dark, and I demand to know what the plans are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pain in Beelo&rsquo;s face deepened, but there was no resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t trust you, Choseph,&rdquo; he said, an appealing look in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked hunted, and blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you and Christopher are going with me for,&mdash;to keep from
      harm the man whom the king will send for, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the danger to him?&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I can only imagine!&rdquo; he passionately said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible.
      I think you understand. And you are to lay plans with Lentala for saving
      the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to press the matter further, but a look from Christopher
      stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to have pained you, dear little brother.&rdquo; I took his hand.
      &ldquo;Will you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and his relief was shaded with anxiety. This parting was the
      first sad one. I also had risen, and the boy was looking up into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trusting you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;trusting you with my life and Lentala&rsquo;s,
      and the lives of many others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll find me worthy, dear little brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He withdrew his hand, took Christopher&rsquo;s arm and pressed it to
      his own side, and peered deep into his eyes. &ldquo;Do you love me, old
      Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo gently slapped Christopher&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer! Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; impressively, &ldquo;if my life were in danger, and you could
      save me by giving your own life, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t answer if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I would die for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a burst of laughter Beelo drew his big head down and laid his cheek
      against it. &ldquo;What an absurd old Christopher!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back, and again turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph, one thing more! As the king&rsquo;s messenger will you again see Mr.
      Vancouver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you wish.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better. Tell him to send the young men out whenever he pleases, and
      to take the passage by which you entered the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all. Good-bye.&rdquo; He walked away slowly with Christopher, and for
      the first time I noticed that he looked as though bearing a burden heavy
      for his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After laying the matter before Captain Mason, I prepared my disguise and
      visited Mr. Vancouver that evening. He and Rawley occupied the same hut;
      Annabel slept in one adjoining. I had previously taken care to note that
      as Annabel was helping a young mother with the care of an ailing infant,
      she would not likely intrude on my visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were startled when they found me standing silently before
      them. In the dim light of a nut-oil lamp I saw Rawley&rsquo;s face blanch, and I
      wondered how he would bear the ordeal fronting him outside the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; eagerly said Mr. Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      After instructing him as to the sending out of the young men, I informed
      him that the king was nearly ready for a man, and added that Rawley would
      be acceptable. Mr. Vancouver was disappointed that he himself could not
      go, but cheerfully said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Mr. Rawley will be glad to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed the young man&rsquo;s dismay. Not so Mr. Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man, it&rsquo;s the opportunity of a lifetime!&rdquo; he declared to Rawley.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger. The king will furnish a safe-conduct&mdash;won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
       he added, turning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Your friend couldn&rsquo;t find the way otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! Brace up, Rawley, and thank your stars for your good fortune.
      You&rsquo;ll have important things to tell me when you return.&rdquo; For all his
      cheering manner, Mr. Vancouver could not conceal his contempt. To me he
      said: &ldquo;Give the king my thanks. Tell him that his kind offer is gratefully
      accepted, and that Mr. Rawley will be ready at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rawley was a bluish white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he faintly said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go, I suppose, but who knows
      what is really to be done with me? I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; With a
      gesture Mr. Vancouver stopped the indiscreet speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the king my message of thanks and grateful acceptance,&rdquo; he snapped
      out in his old business-like way. &ldquo;Mr. Rawley will go whenever he is
      summoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, and turned to leave, but found Annabel blocking the door. Her
      eyes were wide with surprise. She had never before seen natives near the
      camp at night, and never one alone. With unexpected firmness she refused
      to let me pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, Mr. Rawley, what does this mean? Where is Mr. Rawley going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men sat dumb. Annabel&rsquo;s instinct told her that treachery was in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Captain Mason know about this?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver was the first to recover, but he underestimated his
      daughter&rsquo;s shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud, daughter. It is all right. Let the man pass. I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among Annabel&rsquo;s charms was a certain rashness. Here she stood between
      affection and duty, and it would be interesting to observe the outcome. I
      was glad that she continued to bar my escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us three go with this man to Captain
      Mason and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no more nonsense, daughter! Are you aware what your attitude
      toward me means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand. You have never spoken
      this way to me before. Surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This foolishness must stop here,&rdquo; her father brusquely said, rising and
      advancing, with the evident intention of dragging her from the door; but
      something in her face stopped him. It was time for me to interfere, lest
      she spoil everything. The risk was in lending my voice to her sensitive
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows,&rdquo; I gruffly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me and say that to him,&rdquo; she demanded. I nodded again. The
      exasperation and fear in Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s face did not escape his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; he nearly shouted. To me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped him with a knowing look, which he rightly understood to mean
      that it would be well to lay her suspicions by going, and that I might be
      depended on to handle the matter satisfactorily. In truth, I was enjoying
      the situation too much for thought of graver things. And I had never seen
      Annabel so superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you owe this to me, and I owe it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s uneasy face betrayed his predicament. Might he trust my
      ability to deceive Captain Mason? was his evident thought. The peril was
      great. I was maliciously happy over the grinding of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose I should make a slip with Captain Mason: that would mean the
      hangman&rsquo;s noose for Mr. Vancouver,&mdash;I knew he was thinking all that.
      I could not resist the temptation to harry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go,&rdquo; I said to Annabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wavered, but her courage rose, and with reckless heroism she stepped
      out without looking at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed in silence. She did not glance back, and I think she was glad
      that the men remained in the hut. With her head held up by the high
      purpose within her, she walked as though she were above the stars and they
      were her stepping-stones. Once she stopped short. I was certain that love
      had conquered and that she would tell me my willingness to go satisfied
      her, and so would send me away; but she went desperately on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brilliant tropical moon, and the captain was sitting in the
      shine of it on the outer bench of his hut. He rose in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason,&rdquo; panted Annabel, &ldquo;I found this native in our camp just
      now, and I wondered if you knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had recognized me, but Annabel did not see the twinkle in his eyes. He
      knew that I had blundered in letting her discover me with her father. I
      was amazed at the fine delicacy of the man. Instead of asking her
      questions, he demanded an explanation of me. With great caution not to
      betray myself, I said that I had the king&rsquo;s permission to take Rawley out,
      that he might see something of the island, and procure some of the gems so
      abundant there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight revealed the shame that burned Annabel&rsquo;s cheeks because she
      had doubted her father. Would Captain Mason have the tact to cure her
      hurt?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take your hand?&rdquo; he asked. She wonderingly yielded it. As he held
      it and looked down into her lovely face there came into his voice a
      gentleness, a tenderness, that I am certain had been hitherto strange to
      it. &ldquo;This is a wonderful thing that you have done,&mdash;the noblest,
      bravest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It was so not alone
      because it might have meant a matter of life and death, but because it was
      hard to do. I am proud to know and be trusted by such a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears were slipping down her cheeks as he released her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have that kindly regard for me, Captain Mason,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let it
      extend to my father. He meant nothing wrong in violating the rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has special privileges, Miss Vancouver. I will pay no attention to the

      Vancouver&rsquo;s Predicament. Rebellion Breeding. The Arrest. Merciless

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EXT morning the
      young men in Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s plot passed secret looks and words, and Mr.
      Vancouver and Rawley wore an indifferent air too conspicuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel emerged late; she and Dr. Preston had been with the suffering
      child that night; but she looked much more worn and depressed than the
      night&rsquo;s vigil warranted. I greeted her cheerily, and her quiet smile was
      ready. I saw nothing to indicate that she noted anything unusual afoot.
      Captain Mason gave her a pleasant bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colony had early integrated into small social groups, particularly at
      meal-times. We sat on rough benches at two long tables under trees. There
      was a rearrangement of groups at breakfast this morning, so as to bring
      the conspirators together at an end occupied by Mr. Vancouver and Rawley.
      Annabel sat with the children. The maneuver of the men did not escape
      Captain Mason, who was some distance away and at the other table, having
      rigidly held himself aloof from all social preferences. After breakfast he
      gave me an unobtrusive look, and left. I soon followed, and found
      Christopher with him in our hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You noticed, Mr. Tudor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They will go out of the valley today. Lentala will see that they are
      turned back. What shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An amused look came into his eyes. &ldquo;You may abandon your usual plan of
      calling the names of those who shall go to the fields, and announce that
      only volunteers need go. That will spare such of the idiots as are on your
      list from sneaking out of the fields on pretense of headache. Give them a
      long rope. Everything is moving beautifully to a crisis. Take your men to
      the fields. Christopher will stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the insistence of trifles thrusting themselves into a tense
      situation, every small thing of the morning marched with me back to the
      tables. I must observe the progress of some insatiably hungry nestlings in
      a tree, and laugh at a round scolding from their mother. Never had I heard
      so many birds singing at once. The solemn cadence of the waterfall sent a
      Sabbath spirit through the air. The forest shadows quivered with mysteries
      and portents, and the air was drunk with the perfume of many flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel&rsquo;s glance showed that she had noted our leaving the tables, but a
      cheery word from me laid her uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief appeared in some faces when I announced that only volunteers would
      go to the fields that day. Mr. Vancouver studied me, and Rawley was
      nervous. A small crowd responded to my call, and then amused shame swept
      over the men as I good-naturedly laughed at them, with the result that a
      larger squad than usual came forward. I kept Mr. Vancouver in sight, and
      was not surprised to catch him throwing a look at a conspirator here and
      there, causing the guilty to stand forth with the innocent. I knew that he
      suspected something in my departure from the usual way lately of calling
      out the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work in the fields went with a smoothness that gave no hint of trouble
      beneath the surface. The conspirators dropped away one after another, with
      my pleasant assent. Rawley remained. That meant his want of courage to
      join the daring expedition. When the remnant started for camp I went to
      the spot where I expected Beelo and Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for Beelo&rsquo;s appearance came and passed. I had an irksome wait,
      and in spite of my confidence in his skill, I grew uneasy lest he had
      fallen into difficulties. Never before had he failed to keep an
      appointment. His endurance and pluck had been extraordinary. From his home
      at the palace to our meeting-places had been a number of miles, without
      counting his trouble and ingenuity in avoiding detection, and the hard
      labor of scaling the valley wall; yet he had never failed, never
      complained, never mentioned the heroism for which his conduit stood. I
      bitterly accused myself and Captain Mason for our selfishness in accepting
      the boy&rsquo;s allegiance and labors as a mere incident of our struggle to
      escape. My heart went out to him now; I had been remiss in appreciation.
      Had he been of a more aggressive nature, less gentle and timid, relying
      more on force than ingenuity, perhaps my conscience would have been
      easier. The task which it had been so easy for me to send Lentala with
      reference to the malcontents, must have been severe for her, and must have
      involved her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher came at last, but not Beelo. The man reported all well in
      camp; Annabel had been downcast until Captain Mason cheered her; Mr.
      Vancouver was painfully restless; none of the conspirators had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited until all hope of Beelo&rsquo;s arrival was futile. Christopher had
      been listening, but I dreaded to question him. Finally I remarked that we
      must go, as we could not expect Beelo so late. The readiness with which
      Christopher acquiesced assured me that he had not expected the lad, but I
      had no heart to ask him whether he thought that trouble had been the
      detaining cause. We returned to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Preston had much patching of cuticle to do that night, for the young
      men returned after dark. There had been an uneasy hush over the camp all
      day. Upon their arrival, which was accomplished with all possible
      unostentation, a buzz arose and gossip leaked. I was with Captain Mason,
      who sat silent and in grim content as I told him what was going on. We
      were both curious to see what Dr. Preston, a quiet young man of fine
      intelligence, would deem his duty after the urgency of his offices had
      passed. After a while he came, excited and a little frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reported that there were no serious hurts, and that the men would be
      about next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What account do they give?&rdquo; inquired Captain Mason. The twinkle in his
      eyes was lost on the earnest young physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were peaceably exploring the valley, Captain,&mdash;just a lark, you
      know, although it had the serious purpose of finding out anything that
      might be useful in the escape of the colony,&mdash;when they were set upon
      by an overwhelming horde of savages, the evident purpose being to take
      them away by force. Our men, though so greatly outnumbered, held their
      ground, but the scrimmage was close and savage. They would have won
      without the fan-bearer&rsquo;s interference, but her coming up with a personal
      guard put an end to the affair, as she called the natives off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason&rsquo;s amused attention sharpened to a keen interest. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s
      fan-bearer?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the one we saw at the feast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president nodded. &ldquo;They have all told you the same story, I suppose,&rdquo;
       he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In leaving, Dr. Preston looked surprised that Captain Mason should appear
      so indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason announced no plans concerning the young men that night, and
      there was nothing unusual in his bearing next morning when the colony
      assembled for breakfast. All watched him narrowly. When breakfast was
      over, and before we had risen from the tables, he sent Christopher for me,
      for I sat some distance away. As I rose, I had a strong feeling that
      something extraordinary was about to fall to my hand, for I knew Captain
      Mason&rsquo;s nature and his trust in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That brought Beelo vividly to mind. He had seen hardly more than the
      gentler side of me. Indeed, it had doubtless been his own gentleness, his
      innate delicacy and refinement, that had held in subjection the ruder
      elements in me, so deep was my fondness for him. And it had never been
      irksome, though the conduct which it had almost forced upon me was
      strikingly different from that which usually governed me. While I was glad
      that Beelo was not present to see what I knew was coming, still his spirit
      was with me, and so strongly that it was tangible. My whole outlook was
      filled with him, and I could not shake off the feeling that he was really
      near and observing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the impulse, I sent a trained glance into the shadows about the
      camp, and suddenly stopped, for I found his bright eyes peering at me from
      the trees. A closer look discovered that underneath the almost conscious
      mischief that sparkled in his eyes was apprehension. I had a moment of
      anger that he should be there, and tried to give him a look that would
      send him away; but he made a face at me, and with deep misgivings I went
      to my duty, striving to put him out of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call for order,&rdquo; Captain Mason directed, &ldquo;and make a complete statement
      of the affair, omitting Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s connexion with it. Then tell off
      twelve steady men for a guard, and have them arrest all of the young men
      who disobeyed the rule. Manage the details in your own way. I&rsquo;ll take
      command after the arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obedience to authority was a law of my training, but I was aghast, and
      wondered if the man realized that he might be touching a match to a
      magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Vancouver was the danger-center, I glanced at him. He had been
      closely observing the president. I shall not forget the picture that he
      made as I called for order and proceeded with the speech. By no effort
      could he control the emotions that surged to his face,&mdash;his
      consternation at the appalling correctness of my account, his ferocious
      resentment and anger, his sense of being baffled and humiliated while
      being spared from open shame, his white fear that at last he would be
      exposed as the arch-traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed Annabel also, and saw her puzzled uneasiness as I reminded the
      colony of the king&rsquo;s injunction and the great danger of disregarding it;
      her furtive glances at her father; her amazement when I hinted at the plot
      for undermining Captain Mason&rsquo;s authority, and spoke of its secret working
      toward the destruction of the colony; the blanching of her cheeks when I
      described the effort of the young men to slip out of the valley, their
      being beaten and bound, and the mercy that had spared them, whipped and
      wounded, to sneak back in darkness to camp; and the lie they told to cover
      their treachery and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tense pause when I had done, and then I called out the names
      of the guilty. So overwhelming had been the presentation, that, as Captain
      Mason must have foreseen, there was no time for immediate reaction toward
      mutiny. I called out the guard. A death-like stillness followed. Captain
      Mason was standing with the silence and firmness of stone. I stole a
      glance at Beelo and saw that he had slipped round through the trees to be
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rapped out an order for the guard to step forward. They looked round
      curiously at one another, some with a half-smile as they glanced at
      Captain Mason, to see if he approved. His face was expressionless. I
      repeated the order, more peremptorily, and in slowly rising they regarded
      me curiously and in some wonder, as they had never seen me with such a
      bearing. Whatever they saw and heard quickened their action. There was an
      impressive solemnity in the proceeding, and it strengthened them moment by
      moment. I did not hurry them, since it was clear that a sense of serious
      responsibility was rising in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lenardo, step forward and submit to arrest,&rdquo; I sharply said to one of the
      recalcitrants, a decent young carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paled, then flushed, and blunderingly turned to Mr. Vancouver. But that
      gentleman was gazing at me with all the hate of his soul. Annabel shrank
      under the significance of Lenardo&rsquo;s silent appeal to her father. Receiving
      no guidance from Mr. Vancouver, the young culprit sent a fluttering,
      desperate look abroad, picking out his guilty associates. All the comfort
      he got from them was a frightened glance in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impaled man wriggled awkwardly to his feet,&mdash;for I was giving him
      time,&mdash;and with a grin and shrug made a pitiful attempt to treat the
      arrest as a pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand facing that end of the guard-line,&rdquo; I ordered, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Henry,&rdquo; he said to one of the conspirators. The bravado was clearly
      sham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No talking!&rdquo; I ripped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It jerked Lenardo straight, and he came forward and stood where I had
      directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man addressed as Henry slouched up with a faint trace of
      Lenardo&rsquo;s swagger, but my sharp &ldquo;Step lively!&rdquo; electrified him into firmer
      action, and his grin went sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hobart!&rdquo; I next called. I selected him for the third, for I knew his
      independent, rebellious nature, his courage and pride, and wished the
      severest test of the discipline to come at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we had been good friends and he knew that I respected him, he
      stared incredulously, but found me a stranger. Then a vicious look flared
      in his face, and, still sitting, he fingered the handle of a heavy iron
      vessel on the table while regarding me defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited, and then called him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be made a fool of in this way!&rdquo; he cried, rising, his face
      blazing, his hold on the iron vessel tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two guards on the left, do your duty!&rdquo; I commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hesitatingly advanced upon him. Making a great scattering of
      frightened women and children, Hobart stepped back, brandished the vessel,
      and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a free American citizen, I am! I&rsquo;m a law-abiding man and I know my
      rights! Stand back, there,&rdquo; to the guards, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two more guards from the left. Step lively!&rdquo; I called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advance of the four guards was checked by a diversion. Mr. Vancouver,
      who had been sitting in apathetic silence, suddenly spoke out with biting
      clearness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hobart, it is the duty of every one here to submit to authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man opened his mouth in astonishment, and instantly drooped; the
      vessel clattered from his hand to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make trouble now,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve been played low down
      by somebody, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a threatening shoulder-lift at Mr. Vancouver, which deepened that
      gentleman&rsquo;s pallor, Hobart sullenly fell in. I quickly called out the
      other culprits; all obeyed and stood in line facing the guard. Then I
      looked round at Captain Mason for orders.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE president said
      nothing, but gave a signal to Christopher, who brought up a basket
      containing rope-ends and strips of cloth, of native manufacture. I
      understood what I was next to do, and under ordinary circumstances should
      have thought of nothing but the doing; but now a coldness seized my heart,
      for I thought of Beelo, as a horrified witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a craning to see what the basket held, and then came a quick
      drawing of the breath and afterward a hiss as the truth dawned on those of
      quick perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picking up a rope-end, I stood facing the crowd in silence until perfect
      stillness had come. Then I went to Lenardo, the first in line, and said to
      the guard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are any of you experienced in tying a man&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A head-shake was the response of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then observe how this is done,&rdquo; I said. And to Lenardo, &ldquo;Turn your back
      and cross your wrists behind you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the blood fled his face. He glanced about with a shamed, beseeching
      helplessness, his eyes wide with horror and his look an appeal for
      protection from the outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn, and cross your wrists,&rdquo; came my command as evenly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner obeyed, his hands trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cross your wrists.&rdquo; My tone was such as a farrier might use to a horse he
      was shoeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenardo crossed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observe,&rdquo; I repeated to the guards, as I quickly wound the cord and
      knotted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobart watched the proceeding narrowly, his face growing more livid, his
      eyes bulging farther, his breathing uneven. Once he sent a flaming glance
      at Mr. Vancouver, who winced under it, and sat with a sickly, shrunken
      look. I knew that the supreme test of discipline lay ahead, and I was
      warming to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie the next one,&rdquo; I said to two of the guards, handing them a strip. At
      the same time, no longer able to resist a glance at Beelo, I found in his
      stricken face so strange a look that it disconcerted me for a moment. It
      looked to be both horror and appeal. But my duty was plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood by and observed the clumsy work of the two guards in tying the
      second man, who, meeker than Lenardo,&mdash;although both were manly
      fellows,&mdash;submitted more promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobart&rsquo;s turn came next. He was looking about as a trapped beast, and he
      swayed and muttered. It was clear that under the approaching degradation
      he was letting his wits tangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some women, sickened by the scene, and fearing a tragedy from Hobart,
      slipped away, a few softly crying, others very white. They hid in a huddle
      behind the storehouse, the mothers taking their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more turn. Tighter. Work faster,&rdquo; I ordered the guards tying the
      second man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed with nervous eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Hobart&rsquo;s turn. I stood before him. He knew what to do without my
      order, and I was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we any friends among you people?&rdquo; he bellowed, stepping back and
      hardening every muscle. &ldquo;Are you all cowards, to let these brutes ride
      roughshod over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Submit, Hobart,&rdquo; cut Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned upon him, but said nothing, and his cadaverous face whitened
      still more under my stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need no assistance from you, sir,&rdquo; Captain Mason coldly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started; a momentary flash enlivened his sunken eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step up here in line,&rdquo; I said to Hobart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wavered toward submission under Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s order, but my prompt
      suppression of that intervention thrust upon him an angry despair. &ldquo;To
      hell with you!&rdquo; he shouted to me. &ldquo;You bully! You cur! Here, fellows,&rdquo;
       addressing his comrades in line, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be whipped dogs! We are free
      American citizens, we are! Break away!&rdquo; He stepped still farther back and
      edged toward the table. &ldquo;Stand by me! Be men! We&rsquo;ll settle this thing!
      Come on!&rdquo; The line swayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard, re-form the prisoners in line,&rdquo; I ordered. They stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight, boys! Arm yourselves at the tables!&rdquo; Hobart&rsquo;s fierce words
      thrilled the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lively there!&rdquo; I snapped to the guards. &ldquo;Seize Hobart first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tables, boys!&rdquo; shouted Hobart. &ldquo;Romer,&rdquo; he added to a husky young man
      of the party, &ldquo;tackle Captain Mason. I&rsquo;ll attend to Tudor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hobart sprang at Romer, gave him a shake, and shouted, &ldquo;Get to work!&rdquo; and
      then advanced toward me as Romer was hardening for assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hobart had rudely calculated, the moment was snatched by the other
      prisoners for a rush on the guard and the tables, and they broke on the
      bound as Hobart hurled himself upon me. But he was too precipitate, and
      lacked training.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful that any in the camp except myself saw how the next thing
      happened. There was a muffled crack, and Hobart&rsquo;s feet cleared the ground,
      his limbs whipped the air as though he were drowning, and he sprawled on
      the earth in a disorganized, quivering heap. A glance showed me that Romer
      had been stopped two yards from Captain Mason by a look such as he had
      never encountered before, and he stood staring like an imbecile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low cry broke from fifty feminine throats when Hobart&rsquo;s body made its
      impact with the ground. But the entire rush had been paralyzed; it was
      clearly the impression that Hobart had been killed, and all were staring
      from him to me. The guard had responded; the prisoners were in
      subjugation, some by a collar-grip of the guard, others panting on the
      ground under urgent knees, still others standing inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off the prisoners. Re-form the line,&rdquo; I ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this had been done, the young men sullen, sheepish, and silent, and
      viewing with awe the still body of Hobart on the ground, I looked round
      upon the circle till I found the man I wanted. My glance had included
      Captain Mason and found him stolid and motionless as he observed my
      procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Preston, come forward,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He instantly responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please examine Hobart&rsquo;s jaw and neck,&rdquo; I directed. &ldquo;One or the other may
      be broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he was turning away to obey he discovered a red trickle from my right
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carefully examined the heap on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a contusion and a slight brain-concussion,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two,&rdquo; I promptly said to two of the guards, &ldquo;buck and gag Hobart. Do
      you know how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook their heads, but under my direction accomplished what appeared
      to be a disagreeable task. The process consisted in tying Hobart&rsquo;s hands
      and feet, flexing his knees, slipping his arms over them, and thrusting a
      stick under his knees and over his arms, thus reducing him to a helpless
      knot. Then they thrust a towel between his teeth and tied it at the back
      of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I do anything to revive him, sir?&rdquo; asked the doctor. It was
      interesting to hear the &ldquo;sir&rdquo; slip from his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked to Captain Mason for directions, but his face remained void.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. Then to two of the guards, &ldquo;Take him to the shade over
      there, on the ground,&rdquo; indicating a tree near by and in full view of the
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the tying of the other prisoners had gone on rapidly and
      smoothly. When it was finished, I ordered the men taken to the shade and
      lined up behind Hobart, who lay on his side, the guards standing by. The
      prisoners were a very sober-looking crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a lull. I had regarded the subjugation of the men as merely the
      lighter preparatory work for some grave procedure which Captain Mason
      would direct after that was accomplished. At first I was doubtful of my
      wisdom in withholding restorative measures from Hobart, but I had done so
      hoping that it would have the effect both of softening Captain Mason and
      of impressing the other prisoners and the camp at large. Now I had to face
      unknown plans, but Captain Mason still remained mute. It was evident that,
      since quiet had come, it was from him rather than me that the camp awaited
      the next move; it was his crushing mastery that all felt; it was his iron
      hand that lay on every heart. He quietly seated himself, and without a
      glance at me waited, his face wearing the undisturbed calm that
      distinguished it always in dramatic situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women in hiding peered out cautiously, and then joined those on the
      scene. A slight stir, accompanied with murmurs, rose in a spot where the
      women stood thickest, and a shrill voice came angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will! You can&rsquo;t stop me! I say it&rsquo;s an outrage, and I&rsquo;m going to
      untie that boy and take that strangling thing out of his mouth.&rdquo; She was
      advancing, a middle-aged woman, with a determined air, and she walked
      straight toward Hobart, ignoring me as I stood near him. &ldquo;I just want to
      say to you, Mr. Tudor, that it was enough to knock the senses out of him,
      and that it&rsquo;s inhuman and brutal to keep him tied up like an animal. If
      the <i>men</i> in this camp can be bullied and scared, I&rsquo;ll let you know
      that there&rsquo;s a <i>woman</i> who can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to untie that lad, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had stepped forward and laid a kindly hand on her arm as she spoke, but
      she threw it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If you want to strike a woman dead, you
      murdering bully, do it! I dare you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding to two of the guards, I said: &ldquo;Take her to her hut, and keep her
      there. If she makes the least noise, bind and gag her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brute! You coward!&rdquo; she cried, making a dash forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guards gingerly seized her, and she talked and struggled wildly. But
      they dragged her away, and no sound came from the hut. Captain Mason gave
      not the slightest attention to the incident, which greatly deepened the
      depression on the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobart&rsquo;s slow, heavy breathing became regular, then fluttered; his eyes
      opened, and rolled unseeing. Intelligence began to dawn in his face, and
      with it came an unconscious straining at his bonds. That hastened his
      recovery. A wild, clear look that roved a moment and settled malignantly
      on me, showed that he had come to himself. His astonished glance at his
      helpless state preceded an effort for speech that his gag turned to a
      growl, and he made a mighty tug to snap the cords. That failing, he
      twisted his head to see the line of prisoners standing bound. Then his
      gaze found Captain Mason, who was not observing him, and he savagely
      growled and champed his gag.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked furtively round for Beelo, and found him staring at me as at
      something strange and monstrous. It was more than I could bear, and on
      looking away I discovered the gathering of clouds, and then heard low
      thunder in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobart&rsquo;s fury wore itself out. Humiliation took its turn. Toward the end
      came a humbled spirit and dumb pleading. A quickening ran through the
      crowd, and eager, appealing eyes were upon me from every direction; but I
      waited. From humility Hobart sank lower, for the pain of his cramped
      muscles grew worse and worse, making him writhe and groan and strain.
      Still the moment had not come. I knew that many a life hung on the
      precision of my conduct, and Captain Mason did not interfere to the
      slightest extent. At last, when Hobart&rsquo;s dumb pleading had settled on my
      face and did not rove, I said to Dr. Preston:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gag&mdash;nothing else&mdash;may come away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed it, and Hobart panted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Doctor. Take the others off, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician looked to me, but I gave no sign. That started a movement in
      the crowd, and I had to quell that with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him take &lsquo;em off, Mr. Tudor,&rdquo; the prisoner begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and he was free. He labored weakly to a sitting posture, Dr.
      Preston assisting. His head rolled, but he breathed deeply, and steadied
      himself. Dr. Preston felt his pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May he have water and a wet towel, sir?&rdquo; he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. Hobart drank greedily. Dr. Preston mopped his head and face, and
      bound the wet towel over his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a seat for Hobart,&rdquo; I said to a guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobart was lifted to it, and thus sat facing the crowd. He had a finer
      look than I had ever seen from him; he had passed through purgatory. He
      looked openly at the people, and at last his glance rested on Mr.
      Vancouver. It seemed to hold a deep meaning. Mr. Vancouver shrank even
      more than when he had seen the iron hand come down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to Captain Mason and reported that Hobart was conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded, came forward, I beside him, and looked down on the
      beaten man, who anxiously returned the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I say a word, Captain?&rdquo; Hobart asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hobart turned to me. &ldquo;You are a hard man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but square and brave.
      So are you, Captain Mason. I deserved what I got, and a good deal more.
      But I&rsquo;m sorry for what I did, and I ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was frank admiration in Captain Mason&rsquo;s face, for he was observing
      another strong man emerge from the first hard lesson in a discipline that
      the sailor had known for many a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I say something to the boys?&rdquo; asked Hobart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hobart worked round to face his fellow-conspirators. In silence he looked
      at one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we made a mistake, and are beginning to pay. I don&rsquo;t
      know what&rsquo;s going to be done with us, but, whatever it is, we must bear it
      like men. We made an agreement when we came into this valley, and we
      violated it. What we did might have cost the life of every member of this
      colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, for he was weak, and a deep emotion tore him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, if I had been Captain Mason and Mr. Tudor, and had protected and
      trusted the people as they have done, and they had tried to undermine me,
      and to benefit themselves to the harm of the others, I would have them
      taken to the nearest tree, and, God help me! I would have them hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word of that astonishing speech missed an ear in the crowd. When
      Hobart had ended, his head dropped in dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long minute of silence Captain Mason gave me a look. I went to
      Hobart, who raised a sad face to mine. But when he saw my smile and my
      extended hand, a glad surprise leaped in him, and his clasp was that of a
      drowning man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked away. Dr. Preston next received Captain Mason&rsquo;s glance, and the
      scene was repeated. I did not observe the hint that the president must
      have given; but while some of the guard came and took Hobart&rsquo;s hand,
      others were untying the prisoners, and they also came in their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in Hobart&rsquo;s eyes, and his speech had fled by the time
      Captain Mason came up and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man, Hobart,&rdquo; said he, and without noting the effect turned to
      the other conspirators. &ldquo;Young men,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you are at liberty. The
      incident is closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a glance at the assembled colony, he turned away and went to his
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked for Beelo, and saw his signal to follow him. A buzzing rose from
      the crowd. A hard, fixed look was in Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s ashen face. Annabel&rsquo;s
      head rested in her arms on the table, and she was sobbing. From every
      direction I found furtive glances upon me, and wondered whether I had
      become a Pariah. The idea was dispelled by the friendly responses that my
      advances found, but I was uneasy on the score of Beelo.

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;Faces Set Toward Danger.

      <i>Len-tala in Difficulties. The True Story of the Enterprising Young Men.
      Mr. Vancouver Faces the Unknown. Beelo Takes Us on a Journey.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>EELO was much
      excited and torn with impatience when I arrived. Despite that, he regarded
      me with an odd mixture of awe and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you are terrible and cruel! I couldn&rsquo;t have
      believed&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His breath gave out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentle solicitude in my voice steadied him, and he looked with his
      sunny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dear old Choseph, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, everything has
      happened!&rdquo; he flung out. &ldquo;The king is terribly angry with Lentala for
      interfering with the arrest of the young men yesterday. I had to stay with
      her, and couldn&rsquo;t come. I don&rsquo;t know what trouble will come out of it, but
      the king is going to bring matters to a head at once, before we are nearly
      ready! Choseph! those young men ought not to have been let out of the
      valley. Gato is now on his way to the colony for a man, and you must go
      there immediately to attend to it. You must decide which man is to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His news, breathlessly given, stunned me. It was essential that we both be
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what happened to the young men,&rdquo; asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They climbed the wall, and expected to slip through. Why, Senatra men
      rained on them! Len-tala got there as soon as she could with her private
      guard, but it was too late to save them from a terrible whipping. The
      guard had them bound and were taking them to the palace when Lentala
      arrived. She&rsquo;s afraid now that the king will do what he has threatened,&mdash;either
      lock her up or give orders that will tie her hands so that she can&rsquo;t do
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated. &ldquo;If she is powerless, Beelo, there will be no one to protect
      the man who will go out with Gato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His distress was poignant, and he dropped to the ground in a weary little
      heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala is equal to any task, lad,&rdquo; I quietly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up brightly. &ldquo;Do you believe that much in her, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s our one hope, lad, and she&rsquo;ll never falter; and she has your wise
      little head and your bold heart to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came strongly to his feet. &ldquo;She can do anything if you think <i>that</i>
      of her, Choseph,&rdquo; he gently said. Another moment found him his eager,
      active self. &ldquo;A great deal will depend on the man you are to send out,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What awaits him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was an appealing look. His remarks about the earthquakes and
      the storms had puzzled me, and while I knew that the subject was repugnant
      to him, I was forced to revive it. I repeated a remark by Captain Mason
      that a storm was brewing. Beelo straightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason ought to know!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s wise men have told
      him the same thing. Choseph, Choseph! It would be horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, lad? I can&rsquo;t work in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His look was appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You are acting like a child, and this is work for
      men. Tell me what the storm and the earthquake have to do with us, or I&rsquo;ll
      refuse to surrender a man to Gato, and we&rsquo;ll fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; he exclaimed, frightened; then, after a pause: &ldquo;The people
      think the Black Face must have all the castaways, or it will shake the
      ground with earthquakes and maybe send a volcano to destroy everything.
      But if the earthquake is heavy, it terrifies the people. In that way you
      might escape if Lentala&rsquo;s plan fails. It was a great earthquake I was
      hoping for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Black Face must have all the castaways?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he desperately cried. &ldquo;Lentala doesn&rsquo;t know. It has been
      concealed from us. But it&rsquo;s something horrible! A storm is coming, but it
      may bring no castaways, and the king won&rsquo;t wait any longer. He can&rsquo;t
      control the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of man should we send out, Beelo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who&rsquo;s brave and fears nothing,&rdquo; he promptly answered, studying me
      oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Rawley wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had felt it coming. Of course he deserved any risk, any fate, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of Annabel,&rdquo; said Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is innocent. Unless Lentala can keep him away from the king and
      save him from harm, I won&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Choseph!&rdquo; sweetly said the boy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll manage. You&rsquo;ll send
      Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! That will make the king think you aren&rsquo;t suspicious. As soon as he
      has gone with Gato, you and Christopher come here, and then we three will
      go out of the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason&rsquo;s heavy hand still lay as a hush on the camp when Gato, the
      giant leader of the soldiers, arrived an hour later with a band of his
      men. Christopher and I met him, and he informed us that he had come for
      the man who was to be taken out. I despatched Christopher for Captain
      Mason, whom I had informed of the decision to send Mr. Vancouver out. The
      storm had been gathering with a slowness that indicated destructive
      preparation. Mr. Vancouver was in his hut with Rawley and Annabel.
      Rawley&rsquo;s haggard face peered out at intervals and sent a straining look at
      me such as I had seen in the faces of the condemned peering through the
      cell-grate for any messenger that might bear a reprieve. They were not
      aware of our decision that Mr. Vancouver should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president, cool and serious, came with Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summon Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three came out. Mr. Vancouver, though pale, had a firm look, and it
      went straight to Captain Mason. Rawley was ghastly. Annabel held my
      attention most. Undoubtedly Mr. Vancouver had been trying to prepare her
      for the contingency of his leaving, and had made poor work of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance first sought Captain Mason, and found a blank face with no eyes
      for her. Next she looked at me, and caught something that I was too slow
      in hiding. Thenceforward during the scene I knew that the ache within me
      for her sake was large print to her eyes. Her bearing was an accusation, a
      challenge for frankness, an appeal for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vancouver, the king has sent for one of our men. It would be my duty
      to go if I could be spared. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; came the prompt answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel shrank, and then bravely stepped forth. Her voice lost its quaver
      as she proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why send my father?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Are there no young men here with the
      courage to volunteer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eagerly scanned the crowd, not heeding her father&rsquo;s restraining hand
      on her arm. Being a woman, she could never understand why not a single man
      made a sign, so heavy was the weight of Captain Mason&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame!&rdquo; she passionately exclaimed. &ldquo;I had thought there were
      more manliness and gratitude in the world.&rdquo; She turned upon me. &ldquo;Mr.
      Tudor, I know <i>you</i> will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not bear it. &ldquo;May I tell her in confidence what I am to do?&rdquo; I
      asked Captain Mason under my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Miss Vancouver,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;Mr. Tudor cannot
      go. I beg to remind you that you are interfering with the business in
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recollection of the morning&rsquo;s scene, when a woman had been sent away under
      guard, must have been what whitened her face with fear and then flushed it
      with anger. The lion in her father crouched at Captain Mason, but
      instantly remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; he peremptorily said, &ldquo;spare us further humiliation. I am
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I will go with you!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire colony was assembled, and all were expecting another measure of
      authority; but Captain Mason stood in patient silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, child!&rdquo; said Mr. Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have a right to go, and I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver sent Captain Mason an inquiring look, and found that the
      blue eyes had hardened. He knew the meaning of that; he must at once
      eliminate his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he coaxed, enclosing her in his arms, &ldquo;it is impossible,&mdash;dangers
      would arise that wouldn&rsquo;t come if you were absent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; she half sobbed. She struggled
      to free herself. Rawley came forward. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      there a <i>man</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glance from Captain Mason sent Christopher to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father released her, and she turned in astonishment to Christopher.
      Annabel had a sense of the ludicrous, but one of tenderness also. She saw
      the angel behind the clown. Smiles went with her tears as she gave him her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; leaked his thin voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They need you.&rdquo; His gesture swept the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent while she dried her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them there savagers ud eat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t nice to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had laid a daring finger on the mystery, but his words found
      all unheeding except Mr. Vancouver, who looked startled. The suggestion
      was evidently new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Christopher,&rdquo; Annabel said, smiling sadly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay. Captain
      Mason,&rdquo; falteringly, &ldquo;I ask your pardon.&rdquo; She turned to her father and
      embraced him. &ldquo;Father, go. I&rsquo;ll pray for you.&rdquo; She held him off and looked
      long into his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come back, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I shall see the king, and I know I can arrange everything
      happily for the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mason beckoned Gato. Mr. Vancouver turned his face to the darkness
      and marched away with the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Annabel still gazed. Rawley watched her for a look that
      might permit his consoling offices, but she did not see him. Only
      Christopher knew what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a-wanting of you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. &ldquo;What, Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mother, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&mdash;I&rsquo;d forgotten.&rdquo; Without a glance at any of us, she went
      to the ailing child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colony began to stir. After a hurried conference with Captain Mason,
      Christopher and I left to keep the appointment with Beelo. We were ready
      for him when he came all out of breath. It made me uneasy to note that he
      studiedly avoided my eyes and made no reference to the scene in camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a moment to lose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come; follow me&mdash;cautiously.&rdquo;
       His manner betrayed a nervous haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo!&rdquo; I said, seeing that he was too much excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood panting while he got himself in hand, but still kept his face
      turned from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threaded the jungle as though every shrub and tree and turning-place
      were familiar, and held a course on that side of the valley which brought
      us under the Face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His agility taxed me. Not so Christopher: his deftness equaled Beelo&rsquo;s. We
      were a silent trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transverse ridge was crossed, and we entered strange territory.
      Beelo&rsquo;s eyes and ears were incessantly on watch. Now and then he would
      come to an abrupt halt and hold his breath, but nothing appeared. We kept
      to the deepest shadows, which were further blackened by the steadily
      thickening darkness of the sky. I feared a downpour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without mishap we finally reached the lower end of the valley. I had been
      trying to see the opening through which the stream must run, but even when
      we halted near the cliff, not a break appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo dropped to the ground. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the adventure exciting, but was unprepared for its effect on
      Christopher. His usually dull eyes had intelligent vision; his slouchiness
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments&rsquo; rest Beelo rose, and led us to the stream. It was
      deep and slow here, and crept through a dense overhanging growth. We
      pushed through the tangle, and soon came to a little clearing near the
      bank, but screened from it. The bamboo raft which he and Christopher had
      made lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We launched it. Christopher produced a pole from another hiding-place,
      boarded the raft, and knelt on the forward end. Beelo and I followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; the lad inquired, &ldquo;can you see in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Christopher shoved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vegetation grew denser as we slipped along, and its shadows combined
      with the darkness of the day to plunge us into night. Presently I realized
      that we must have traversed more than the distance between the
      launching-place and the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we, Beelo?&rdquo; I asked, but the sound of my voice informed me
      before the boy&rsquo;s answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the mountain. We are going through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To describe my sensations would be impertinent. Beelo&rsquo;s reticence was more
      than silence. The only sound was the swish of Christopher&rsquo;s pole as it
      dipped and scraped while we drifted. Beelo, sitting a little to the rear
      and at one side of me, crept nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk,&rdquo; he begged, edging still closer, till our arms touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, lad. Shall I tell you a story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We must have been on the floor of a lofty cavern, for my words came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand was groping for mine. Perfect blackness encompassed us. I took
      his hand. A slight tremor thrilled it, and I put an arm about his
      shoulders, drew him close, and pressed his head down in the hollow of my
      neck. There was none of his refractory wildness now. Poor lad! For all the
      pluck that he had shown in the past, the silence and the darkness of this
      grew-some passage had unmanned him. It was good to hear the comfort in his
      sigh, the fading of the tremor, and the firm grasp of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Beelo had never made this trip before, but I wondered that at
      least its upper end had been left unguarded and why it was not a highway
      for the natives. In a whisper I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is guarded,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but when a storm or an earthquake comes,
      the men are afraid that what is in here will come out; and, besides, they
      think a storm is a better guard than they. But they weren&rsquo;t far away. I
      knew how to avoid them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down!&rdquo; came sharply from Christopher simultaneously with a dull blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flattened Beelo and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up,&rdquo; said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had his face or head encountered a low-hanging rock? Yet he had thought of
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your head strike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arm, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps an inscrutable power had given him the sense to raise his arm and
      guard his head at the moment of peril. I finished my question to Beelo:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is in here the natives fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voices that send your words back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they are familiar with the echo in the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this kind, Choseph.&rdquo; He had never called me that so easily. I hugged
      him closer, and he nestled like a kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a startling echo. At times even our whispers seemed to
      multiply and flock on wings, and come rustling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something still worse,&rdquo; added Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They would never tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ...I wondered whether he had felt the sudden leap of my heart. He must,
      for he snuggled closer, withdrew his hand from mine, caressed my cheek,
      and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lad, but if we knew only a little we should be the better prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing about it?&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But natives have gone through safely, else they wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some did, a long time ago. That was the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some did? Not all that started?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all. The others went mad. Don&rsquo;t talk about it, dear Choseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly Beelo had been driven to a desperate extremity to choose this
      way of escape from the valley. It showed how closely the ordinary outlets
      were guarded.

      <i>Plunged Into Mysterious Terrors. Christopher&rsquo;s Obscure Powers at Work.
      A Struggle for Our Lives. Stout Hearts Fail. A Dear One Lost.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE passage was
      crooked. The darkness was unqualified, and so dense that it seemed
      resistant and hard to breathe. It was the sort of blackness that
      penetrates to the heart and quenches the light there. Matches had long ago
      disappeared from the colony, and I had no means of making a light. Nor had
      Beelo provided against the blackness. All time-reckoning had been lost,
      but our rate was slow, and I knew that the passage must be long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far the odors had been of the sun-sweetened water crossed with those
      of the underground dank, and were pleasant. But presently a faint pungency
      invaded the cold air. I knew by the change in Beelo&rsquo;s breathing that his
      quick sense had discovered it. It suggested things over which my memory
      halted. Christopher gave no sign. With unflagging watchfulness, aided by a
      perception far keener than mine, he kept the raft free in the stream,
      except for occasional bumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you smell it, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval before his answer, &ldquo;Fire, sir.&rdquo; Beelo cowered in my
      embrace. Since Christopher had mentioned it, I knew it was fire; I cannot
      say how I knew, because the odor was unlike that from any combustion I had
      ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is burning?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This silence was longer than the other; Christopher must have listened
      far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo shook with a silent chuckle, and squeezed my hand; but I knew that
      Christopher&rsquo;s words had a meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world?&rdquo; I quietly repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo and I straightened up and set our ears on a strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear nothing,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear it, very faint,&rdquo; Beelo breathlessly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made no difference with the steadiness of Christopher&rsquo;s work. The odor
      gradually grew more pronounced, and then I recalled an iron smelter that I
      had seen in boyhood. Presently I too heard a distant roar as of a furnace
      that ground while it burned. Beelo crept close under my arm again. I could
      feel his quick heart-beats and shortened breathing against my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping through these increasing sensations came the deep note of falling
      water. Why ask Beelo whether he had ever heard that our stream took a
      subterranean plunge? Christopher kept coolly at his task. The sharp
      striking and scraping of his tireless pole had long ago informed me that
      rock made our channel and shores, which were uneven and dangerous. Now and
      then the raft would make a sudden swing to avoid underwater rocks that
      Christopher&rsquo;s soundings had discovered. At other times it would come to a
      lurching halt until the man carrying our lives in his hand had made sure
      of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that water falling, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a long time, and his slow answer chilled me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go slow when we come nearer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beelo gave me a hand-pressure intended to silence my foolish tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a growing intensity in the odor, in the furnace roar, and in the
      rumbling of the waterfall, came stealing something new and surpassingly
      uncanny. It was a very dim glow, with no visible source, and without the
      power to make anything seen but itself. Apparently it was but the darkness
      in a more oppressive phase. In vain did I strain my eyes to see
      Christopher, Beelo, the raft, the water,&mdash;anything that light could
      make visible; but the glow was as impenetrable as the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo was going to pieces under the weight of this encompassing awe. I
      knew that his weakness was born of his yielding to an extraneous reliance&mdash;Christopher
      and me. He put his lips to my ear and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, lad. You are our guide; you are responsible for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; He made a pathetic effort to regain himself. &ldquo;This light&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you <i>feel</i> it, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, dear lad, but my name isn&rsquo;t Choseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yoseph!&rdquo; he triumphantly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tudor!&rdquo; In a whirlwind he threw both arms round my neck, and softly
      laughed. The old Beelo was on guard again, except that with his recovered
      courage he was uncommonly gentle and affectionate. I wondered if I should
      ever reach the end of the boy&rsquo;s phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      From some indeterminate direction came the muffled sound of an explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold tight!&rdquo; cried Christopher, violently lurching the raft round and
      jamming it sharply against high jutting rocks on the bank. &ldquo;Down!&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty rush as of many winds came tearing up the passage far ahead. I
      threw Beelo face down, and flattened my body. Then came the blow, and
      hurled Christopher backward upon us. In a moment he had recovered himself.
      The impact must have strained Beelo&rsquo;s ribs, but he lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a combination of atmospheric concussion and hot gases, principally
      steam, that had struck us. I raised my head, gasping for breath. Beelo was
      inert. I lifted him. One arm feebly groped for my neck, and clung there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are safe!&rdquo; I cheerily said. &ldquo;Where is my brave little brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He only held me the closer. Indeed, speech was difficult, since the air
      was packed with smothering vapors. The desire to breathe was checked by an
      instinctive fear to inhale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher cautiously pushed out, and again we drifted free, The pole
      dipped and clicked and scraped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a change had come. The furnace roar had ceased; the waterfall grew
      louder. Most striking of all was the unearthly luminosity of the steam
      filling the tunnel. That vapor, rapidly chilling in the cold of the
      passage, increased in opaqueness, but glowed the more. Before long the
      light became radiant and faintly illuminating, and the air sweetened. I
      had known by Beelo&rsquo;s breath on my cheek that his face was upturned to
      mine, and near. Thus it was that after long peering I found the light in
      his eyes. My arms were enclosing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see my lad!&rdquo; I said in gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer little movement of withdrawal began. I tried to hold him, but
      found no yielding. Gradually he slipped out of my clasp, and sat alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher slowly took body in the haze, a ghostly Charon on the Styx.
      The color of the glow grew from white to rose, with an occasional
      effulgence of bluish purple. The surface of the earth knew no such tints
      in fire; these were royally plutonic. The black rocks overhead and on
      either hand assumed a vague, grim definition, and to my keyed fancy
      displayed grotesque suggestions. Blank spaces a shade darker than the
      grimacing, minatory rocks fell away; these I supposed to be cavernous
      reaches out of the passage, for from them came echoed multiples of the
      pole-sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature began to rise as the waterfall grew louder, the light more
      revealing, the haze weaker. We swung round a wide curve, and all at once a
      terrifying vision sprang forth in a blood-red light. Our stream opened
      into a small lake, which was violently churned by a cataract of crimson
      water brilliantly illuminated and plunging out of the overhead darkness
      into it. The roar was deafening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo, scrambling in terror to his feet, his eyes blazing with the red
      madness that packed the cavern, required a strong hand to subdue him. He
      struggled in my grasp, pointed frantically backward with implorings that
      we return, and fought my restraint with sheer animal desperation.
      Christopher&rsquo;s conduct, though showing extraordinary exhilaration, betrayed
      no fear, but only a grimmer hold on our situation. With a rearward glance
      and the discovery that I was holding Beelo securely, he stood up, a
      gigantic red figure, and with all his might shot the raft forward into the
      maelstrom. The frail thing plunged in the surge, but Christopher&rsquo;s eye and
      arm were sure. The suck of the water, curving downward where the cataract
      struck the pool, was cunningly avoided as he circled the rim of the
      lakelet, having as able work to do in avoiding the dripping rocks there as
      in keeping out of the breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked God there was light, formidable though it was; it helped me in
      my control of Beelo, whose struggles were becoming weaker, and enabled me
      to find a good grip on the raft, for there was danger of slipping off.
      Through all the wild lurching Christopher kept a sailor&rsquo;s feet; and,
      although his back was toward me, I saw by his quick movements that all his
      shrewd forces were in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence came the light? It appeared to be in the cataract itself, a living
      flame in the heart of its greatest enemy. The water was joyously, terribly
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raft described an arc of the pool, slipped out of the boiling churn,
      and, before Christopher was aware, caught an eddy and went swinging and
      lurching in behind the cataract. The man so strong in both soul and body
      threw up his hands in the surrender of terror, for a thing more awful than
      the red light and the waterfall confronted us. He dropped the pole. Its
      middle struck the edge of the raft, and our one weapon of defense
      rebounded into the water. Beelo saw the catastrophe. He clutched me
      frantically about the neck, nearly strangling me before I broke his hold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Christopher looked about for the pole, and saw it bobbing on end as it
      struggled against submergence in the down-thrust behind the fall. It was
      twenty fatal feet away. The ferocity of elemental self-preservation seized
      on the man and transformed him. This was not the attitude of patient,
      gentle Christopher, the humble, serving Christopher, but that of a bayed
      animal. My hands were tied by the necessity of Beelo&rsquo;s care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectacle that had unmanned Christopher was in a profound recess
      reaching indeterminately out of the cavern and behind the waterfall. It
      had not been visible until we rounded the fall and went scurrying behind
      it in the eddy. Apparently far back,&mdash;I cannot guess how far,&mdash;ran
      a broad, high, fantastically irregular tunnel ending in a pit of boiling
      lava, at an unknown depth below the level of the tunnel, which itself was
      slightly above the surface of the pool. Deep rumblings issued from it, as
      from a heavy ebullition, punctured with smothered detonations. Rising from
      it were thin, cloud-like masses of vapor, like the pale mauve haze of
      distant mountains. In its rolling it thickened concealingly here and
      opened revealingly there, with constantly shifting effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant color was a deep, transparent crimson of a tint such as may
      be seen in the cooling iron of a foundry or in the great crater of
      Kilauea; but following the detonations came leaping flames of bluish
      purple. It was the red shining through the water that had made the
      cataract a fall of liquid crimson when seen from the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the funnel of a volcano, with a lateral vent. Was it one
      of Pluto&rsquo;s cooling forges? Was its present activity transient? Was this
      the beginning of a seismic convulsion that might blow the valley rampart
      into the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot say when those questions arose. The urgency of an immediate
      threat demanded all attention. Beelo was in an ecstasy of terror, and
      Christopher was desperately casting about with all his reassembled wits.
      In the tumult of noises our voices were useless. We had been flung out of
      the larger eddy into a smaller one swirling between the back of the fall
      and the tunnel-mouth. It had a swifter and more dizzying whirl. Soon it
      seemed that we were still, except for the ceaseless rolling of our craft,
      and that the roaring fall and the grumbling, blazing tunnel were swinging
      round us. With the rest passed the bobbing pole, a live, insane thing,
      nodding this way and that, approaching the downpour gingerly, diving under
      a sharp water-blow, and leaping up with malicious sprightliness a few feet
      back. At any moment it might be caught sidewise and crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another danger. The centrifugal force of our swing in the eddy
      was carrying us out to the periphery of the swirl. On one side were the
      rocks at the mouth of the tunnel; opposite was the waterfall, the
      slightest blow from which (since it fell from a height of at least a
      hundred feet) would mean the end. Our swinging was taking us nearer to
      both those dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something roused within, overcoming my pity for Beelo. I shook him and
      slapped his cheek. Astonishment and anger blazed in his eyes, and then
      with a mighty indignation he crawled away and sat glaring at me. At
      another time the comical picture would have amused me, for the boy behaved
      just as a proud kitten under similar treatment. Having secured the desired
      result with Beelo, I worked to the edge of the raft, and prepared to make
      a leap for the pole. I was waiting till the raft should swing round and
      bring me nearer. Before that happened, two soft arms were flung round me
      from behind, a cheek pressed mine, and I was borne down backward. Two
      small, firm hands held my wrists down. For the moment I was helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Christopher knew that our nearer approach to danger brought us
      closer to hope, which lay in the pole. He was biding the moment, and it
      came. He crouched on the raft, and a long arm shot out. Beelo&rsquo;s nerves
      were quivering till Christopher rose; then they stilled, and he released
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had learned from experience, and it was a surer hand now that
      gripped the pole and sent the raft spinning out of the eddy. To keep it
      somewhat trimmed against Christopher&rsquo;s movements had been a small part of
      my task hitherto, so thoughtful of everything had he been; but now that he
      saw Beelo and me better used to the situation, he quietly gave us
      something of that to do, thus securing more freedom of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the egress of the stream from the pool, and pushed out. Slowly we
      crept through the gloomy, misty light, which paled as we went. Christopher
      must have felt a dread that oppressed me&mdash;the danger of recurrent
      explosions&mdash;for he worked with less extreme caution than before, and
      our progress was better. After a time the light was too dim for me to see
      Beelo sitting in his sullen pout; and when darkness again fell, he crept
      up beside me and stole out a hand for mine. The noises had nearly ceased,
      and Beelo no longer feared the weird echoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s past,&rdquo; he sighed, nestling against me. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you,
      Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hugged my arm and softly laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed many hours since we had entered the passage, and I hoped we
      should emerge in the morning of the day following that of our start.
    </p>
    <p>
      New conditions began to arise. Above the cataract the stream had been
      slow, with few approaches to rapids. Those had been the worst
      danger-points. Now we discovered that the current was swifter and the
      rapids more numerous and turbulent. The celerity of Christopher&rsquo;s
      movements increased. He no longer tried to spare us the water dripping
      from his pole as he repeatedly shifted it and groped for bearings. This
      made me more apprehensive. I wondered whether, even with better
      facilities, we could return to the valley through this passage, and how
      the two hundred and fifty colonists could manage to come safely through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I felt in the water a turgidity where the current was slow, and
      heard a hoarse, growling rumble quite different from the sounds that we
      had left behind. Beelo tightened his clutch and breathlessly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Except for an unusual slapping of the water against the rocks, the
      commotion had passed. I wondered if the storm had broken in the valley and
      the torrent was coming; but this did not look like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gone, Beelo. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it hasn&rsquo;t. Hold tight. Sit hard, Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I impatiently demanded, &ldquo;you must tell me what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speech was stopped by a groaning crunch that tossed the stream,
      splashed the water high on the rocks, and filled the passage with a sound
      like that of crushing glass. Beelo was again in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, lad. There&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; he desperately commanded. &ldquo;The third one will come. That&rsquo;s
      the worst. Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seconds dragged through an awful silence. Beelo&rsquo;s breath struggled
      spasmodically through the repression under which he tried to hold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third shock came, and then, though I had never felt one before, I knew
      what it was. The whole world seemed to heave and writhe and jolt and
      grind, all with a fearful noise. The earthquake, grim brother of the
      boiling cauldron we had left, had us in its jaws, and its power was
      manifest in the ease with which it crushed and ground the rocks about us.
      Fragments of these began to splash in the water and rattle on the raft.
      Just in front, a huge block plunged into the stream and dashed us with
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo flung himself upon me; I again bent over him to shield him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another heavy stone struck the raft in the narrow space between
      Christopher and us, and tore through it into the water, sending up a
      geyser through the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stiffening wave of terror overswept Beelo. He sprang to his knees and
      tightly embraced my neck in both arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to die!&rdquo; he feebly cried, and pressed his lips to mine,
      sinking inert into my arms. My fingers anxiously sought his pulse. It was
      fluttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; I called in alarm,&mdash;not realizing that the earthquake
      had passed and that a dim light made visible the rocks in a turn ahead,&mdash;&ldquo;Christopher!
      Something has happened to Beelo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; came with the steady old calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! We must do something for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We swung the curve, and the blessed daylight smiled ahead. The raft slid
      out of the passage in placid water, which here, as at the other end, was
      deeply embowered. The glorious day, though overcast, was brilliant to our
      eyes as it sifted through and rested sweetly on the water. As Beelo was
      unconscious, Christopher observed extraordinary care in proceeding, and as
      soon as possible secured the raft in the sheltered reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking down into Beelo&rsquo;s face. His head had fallen back, and
      although his eyes were closed, his lips were open. It came over me with a
      pang that a richness and a maturity which I had not before noticed in his
      face, rested there now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has it taken us to come through?&rdquo; I asked Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mos&rsquo; four hours, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised. It had seemed much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to lift Beelo out, but I myself bore him ashore and laid him on
      the ground, and knelt over him. Christopher was standing near, studying
      him, but showing no anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only fainting, isn&rsquo;t it, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To give him air, I began to open his blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; interposed Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, looking up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only regarded me in silence. At first I thought that Christopher&rsquo;s
      singular penetration had discovered that Beelo was lighter of color than a
      full-blooded native and was delicately warning me not to invade the
      carefully guarded secret. I recalled the story that I had told Beelo, and
      my suspicions as to the purity of his native blood. And what harm could
      come if I did learn?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the truth came upon me with the overwhelming force of long
      cumulation. His conduct in the tunnel, his sweetness and gentleness, the
      strange conclusion of the scene with Annabel when they had met,&mdash;a
      thousand memories of things that had passed unheeded in the stress of
      dangers,&mdash;came as a blinding light. I do not know when Christopher
      learned the truth, but in his chivalry he would have seen me go blind to
      the grave without a word from him in betrayal of Beelo&rsquo;s secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock stunned me, and my head was bowed in reverence. When I again
      looked into the patient face, now having for me so sweet and touching a
      pathos, the deep-blue eyes were looking up into mine; then they turned to
      Christopher, and all about. The old mischievous, bantering smile parted
      the perfect lips. The eyes again sought mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph! It&rsquo;s fine to be dead!&rdquo; But the voice held a different music from
      that of the lad whom I had loved and who was now gone forever.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> Would respect
      Beelo&rsquo;s wish that she appear as a boy, and must keep hammering into my
      mind the words, Boy, Lad, Dear Little Brother. I must not for a moment
      think of her otherwise. &ldquo;Boy, Lad, Dear Little Brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you dreaming, Choseph, and what are those words your lips are
      saying?&rdquo; It was Beelo&rsquo;s cheery voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting up; I was beside him looking down at the gliding water. I
      woke to the familiar raillery, and turned with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lad!&rdquo; I joyfully responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had forgotten me,&rdquo; he ruefully said. &ldquo;And you, old Christopher! Don&rsquo;t
      you see I&rsquo;m dying of thirst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher plucked two large leaves, fashioned them into a cup, and
      brought the water, which Beelo eagerly drank. He held out his hand, and I
      helped him up. He tried his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect grace of movement, the exquisite feminine figure so artfully
      concealed,&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy, Lad, Dear Little Brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mooning again, and talking to yourself!&rdquo; cried Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a rough trip through the passage, boy. I&rsquo;m a little shaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s past. Shake the other way.&rdquo; He was pirouetting round a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are we going back, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he carelessly answered, making wing-motions with his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was an earthquake, Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, and his eyes lighted deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he softly but impressively exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old caution settled in his face; he peered and listened warily, and
      then came a look of assured repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;if&mdash;&rdquo; a cloud drifted over his face&mdash;&ldquo;if
      they felt it on the surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did,&rdquo; interposed Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Beelo sharply demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher pointed to a large rock near us, to the path that it had
      freshly torn through the brush, and to a steep slope from which it had
      been dislodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for Christopher!&rdquo; said Beelo. He studied the sky, and dejectedly
      added, &ldquo;But the storm is coming!&rdquo; After a little reflection he remarked,
      as if to himself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that should change our plans or
      not.&rdquo; He seated himself to think it out, and began arranging twigs on the
      ground. &ldquo;No Senatras will be within miles of the passage,&rdquo; he ruminated.
      &ldquo;They fear it, for the earthquake is born here, and they have run away.
      So, we can make better time. Mr. Vancouver is safe today; we won&rsquo;t go <i>there</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, dear little brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pain crossed his face. &ldquo;To the clearing opposite the Face. If only another
      earthquake would come, or this had come sooner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is one usually followed by another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often. Sometimes not. Come! The sun will be setting before long, and we
      have miles to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hid the battered raft and struck out. Our way led parallel to the
      stream, which tore foaming down a gorge of steeply sloping sides. It
      slipped into a pleasant valley, richly verdured. There we left it and
      began the ascent of a mountain on the west. Dusk was coming on. Beelo
      fearlessly pursued the trails in the darkening hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally we paused to rest. The valley which we had crossed lay a
      black-green sea below. Behind us the eastern sky was cut straight across
      by the level summit of our valley wall. Beelo was closely studying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see no sign of fire over there, do you?&rdquo; he asked, pointing toward
      the clearing opposite the Face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was none, and Beelo was gratified. Our attention was diverted from
      that spot by a faint purplish flash, which slipped along the crest above
      the river passage, and was quickly gone. Beelo stood tense and still, and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We waited for its reappearance, but none came. Beelo said no more. The
      light had come from the subterranean lava-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the wall was the blackest part of the sky. Under the horizon in
      that direction lightning was at play, as we judged from faint
      illuminations in the distant heavens, and the rumble of far thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had nearly fallen when we reached the summit. The descent was rapid
      on the other side, for Beelo went with the sureness of familiarity. At
      last we stopped at an abandoned hut, hidden in the deep forest. Beelo
      paused on the door-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a glow a mile or less away, down the valley.
      &ldquo;That is the main settlement of the Senatras. The king&rsquo;s palace, where
      Lentala and I live, is there. We will visit it tonight,&mdash;if Lentala
      agrees. You will rest here awhile and have something to eat. After the
      visit to the palace you will sleep here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed us within, closed the door, blew a flame from smothered embers
      on the hearth, and lighted a nut-oil lamp. He had been very sober and
      quiet all the way, but now his eyes began to dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your mansion!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place had been made clean and sweet, good beds of leaves were on the
      earth floor, and fresh water stood in calabashes. Beelo dragged forward a
      copper vessel, and took from it a generous food supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she pretty good&mdash;for a girl?&rdquo; he casually asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala. She did these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ever since the scene at the end of the passage, sadness had sat upon me,
      and I was in no mood to enjoy Beelo&rsquo;s pleasantries,&mdash;this, too, while
      I was deeply touched by the labor and gentle thoughtfulness with which
      everything had been done for our comfort. Still, something precious was
      gone from my life; my heart hungered for the lad. But he was here! In a
      swirl of perversity I seized Beelo&rsquo;s hands, and held him before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lad,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am walking in the dark. Believe me, little brother,
      I am grateful&mdash;more grateful than any words could say&mdash;for the
      skill and the kindness that we have seen from you. But my heart is sore,
      and you are laughing at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something between suspicion and embarrassment had been rapidly growing in
      Beelo&rsquo;s face. Of a sudden he closed my mouth with his hand and made a
      brave rally of Beelo&rsquo;s old flippancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did you ever see such a goose? Such an <i>old</i>
      goose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gently removed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am serious, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; commanded Beelo in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hunt down into me was ruthless, but the hurt there helped me to steady
      my gaze. &ldquo;When I fainted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and stopped, having
      found my face expressionless. He turned to Christopher, who, giving no
      attention to us, was setting out the supper on a mat. Beelo&rsquo;s sharp eyes
      came back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear little brother,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Not a word!&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time, and you are hungry.
      Come, Choseph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned me to the supper and forced me to sit on the ground opposite
      Christopher. It was pleasant to be man-handled by Beelo. His abuse of me
      was always smoothed by affection. I had no appetite, but who could resist
      Beelo? He played that I was an invalid and unable to help myself. He
      patted my cheek, put food into my mouth, chattered nonsense as though I
      were a baby, and petted me with outrageous condescension. There was
      nothing to do but melt under his dear absurdities; and when he found me
      re-established, he kissed me on the forehead and dashed out, calling that
      he would be back before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned he was brilliantly alive. There seemed no end to his
      vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo; he cried, seizing Christopher and sending his bulk in a
      twirl across the hut. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid!&rdquo; he went on, smashing my dignity
      with boy&rsquo;s play. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But his breath was gone, and he
      tumbled in a panting heap on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Beelo?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up, but as yet had meager breath for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vancouver&mdash;is safe. Doesn&rsquo;t look very&mdash;happy. Hasn&rsquo;t seen&mdash;the
      king. Oh, no! Lentala,&mdash;who is an Angel&mdash;and Sweet&mdash;and
      Kind&mdash;and Beautiful,&mdash;is just dying&mdash;to see you. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest a minute,&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung a little pout at me, and then archly demanded, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
      good-natured yet, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be when you see Lentala,&rdquo; he said with mock melancholy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you like girls?&rdquo; he suddenly fired at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;es,&rdquo; I stammered consciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like Annabel!&rdquo; with a spitfire touch on his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once liked, very much, a dear lad named Beelo more than any girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Once</i> liked Beelo!&rdquo; His shining eyes were lances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him just as much yet&mdash;when he is Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew by his start that the thin ice on which I walked was cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is he when he isn&rsquo;t Beelo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> dead,&rdquo; he said, and a briskness
      sprang into his manner. &ldquo;We must go. Most of the Senatras have already
      gone to sleep. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rapidly led us into the valley, meanwhile instructing us how to respond
      if greeted. The natives were not garrulous nor inquisitive, and we passed
      unnoticed, until the outskirts of the settlement were reached. There, in a
      dimly lighted hut, Mr. Vancouver was resting under guard, Beelo informed
      us. A barely visible figure challenged Beelo. The prompt response made the
      shape sink from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time to see Mr. Vancouver now,&rdquo; said the lad to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turn in a lane lined with huts brought us into a beautiful highway,
      broad and white, and picketed with odorous trees which arched overhead.
      The darkness would have been profound but for a diffused light which
      glowed ahead upon something white. We went rapidly toward it, and found it
      to be a high stone wall; the light was from two lamps on posts where the
      highway swung to the left and ran at the foot of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of following the main road Beelo turned into a narrow way to the
      right. The overhead growth was so dense that the light from the lamps was
      soon lost, but Beelo knew the way. At last he stopped, and slipped a key
      into a lock. The heavy wooden door, plated and strapped with iron,
      suggested a postern in an archaic fortress. He led us within and secured
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearer approach of the storm brought lightning, which increased
      Beelo&rsquo;s caution while revealing glimpses of our environment. In the region
      behind the wall the verdure was less dense and more orderly than in the
      park through which we had come. The lightning made the open spaces
      embarrassing to our guide, who hurried us across them to the shadows.
      Finely kept paths wound and intersected, but Beelo knew shorter routes. A
      rising wind assisted the stealth of our progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought us under the shadow of a low arcade, open on one side, and
      closed on the other with a long stone house. The pillars were massed in
      vines. Here the darkness was intense. The stone floor gave no sound under
      our tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beelo stopped us, advanced a few paces, and rapped on a door. It was
      cautiously opened, but we could not see within as Beelo entered. A very
      faint light barely made him visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;they are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice fuller and mellower than Beelo&rsquo;s yet much like his, answered,
      &ldquo;Yes? I had given you up, and was undressing for bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll dress?&rdquo; Beelo spoke nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tell them to wait a little while. They are safe out there. Beelo,
      the king is furious because you ran away tonight. He is waiting for you.
      Go at once. It is something about the man from the colony.&rdquo; I resented her
      domineering manner toward Beelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can,&rdquo; he answered sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back to us, he began to explain, but I told him we had heard. A
      reassuring hand was given to each of us, and he was hurrying across the
      garden fronting the arcade. He halted and came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay with Lentala longer than ten minutes,&rdquo; he earnestly said. &ldquo;The
      king may detain me. If I don&rsquo;t come, can you find your way back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him that we could, and that even should he come, we would not
      let him conduct: us to the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave my hand a grateful little squeeze as he slipped the gate-key into
      it, and darted away, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait at Lentala&rsquo;s door till she opens it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently she bade us enter. Instead of her barbarous but highly becoming
      dress at the feast, with neat jacket and short skirt blazing with gold
      embroidery, she now wore a plain, loose garment. It was partly redeemed by
      a low cut in the neck, a splendid girdle consisting of a heavy and
      elaborately linked chain of gold, and a necklace of wonderful diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not have explained why this dazzling woman, who had filled so wide
      a space in my fancy, now looked a negligible quantity, an intrusion. There
      was little of the sparkle that I had expected. The childlike coquetries,
      the careless abandon, the subtleties that had flitted so unconsciously
      through the conduct of the Lentala I remembered,&mdash;these and a
      thousand other graces were absent from the sedater young woman smiling
      upon us and composedly seating us.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had greeted us with a warning finger on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My servants,&rdquo; she explained in a low, rich voice, &ldquo;are all in bed and
      asleep. But they are not far away, and we must be careful.&rdquo; There was a
      curious reminder of Annabel&rsquo;s preciseness in this new Lentala.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must have felt my discomfort, for she let some of her consciousness
      slip away, and a dash of her native wildness gradually returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo has told me everything,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not trouble you with
      questions. And we are not to discuss any plans tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beauty and richness of the room came forth, faint in the light of
      suspended lamps, which, clouded in thin fabrics, cast no shadows and
      softened all contours. A rich massing of hammered gold and silver, of
      exquisite bronzes and ivories, of hangings and rugs, was softened to grace
      by their perfect arrangement, and over that in turn was a fine breath of
      daintiness. My astonishment grew as the significance of it came over me.
      Did this girl, all seeming innocence, gentleness, and kindness, <i>feel</i>
      none of the crime and blood with which these treasures were drenched? Yet
      only the sweetest of spirits could have cast upon this charnel-house loot
      the cleansing that held its grisly suggestion back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been moving about and gently chatting, and I had made empty
      responses. At last I discovered that she was growing nervous. A heavy
      crash of thunder brought out the cause. She looked anxious, and said: &ldquo;The
      storm is near. You must go before it breaks. Beela&rdquo;&mdash;I noted her odd
      pronunciation of the final syllable&mdash;&ldquo;said that if he didn&rsquo;t return
      in ten minutes you must go without him, but I can&rsquo;t think of that. He has
      been gone much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to assure her that we could go alone, but still she was uneasy.
      Christopher and I rose. She came and laid a hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little while.&rdquo; She hesitated over the next words. &ldquo;Do you like
      Beela&mdash;Beelo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; I answered dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      A liquid softness entered her beautiful eyes, and with it a sparkle of the
      old Lentala&mdash;and of Beelo too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you a secret,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You will keep it?&mdash;and
      you, Christopher? And you&rsquo;ll not let Beelo know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pledged ourselves. She removed her hand, looked down, and while busying
      herself with a readjustment of her girdle, said, very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo isn&rsquo;t a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers stopped in her acute tension. I stood silent. With an effort
      she raised her eyes to mine, and hers betrayed a keen suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo is a girl,&rdquo; she added, as though I had not heard. &ldquo;Her name is
      Beela.&rdquo; She found my look coolly meeting hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liked Beelo the boy,&rdquo; she groped on; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you like Beela the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not acquainted with her,&rdquo; I fumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the Lentala of the feast returned in a look of mischievous
      amusement, followed by one of pretended sorrow. I was enjoying the fine
      play in her face..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that in knowing and liking the boy, you
      knew and liked the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been impossible for me to make her understand that I was not
      nimble in violent readjustments; so I held my peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was Beela the girl all the time,&rdquo; Lentala insisted. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have
      been anything but the girl in her that you cared for.&rdquo; She did not know in
      the least that she was talking to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed I, very uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My tone made her turn impatiently away. With much spirit she went on as
      with ease and softness she paced the floor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all she has done, too! I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala!&rdquo; I interrupted; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I do like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her voice was growing unsteady. &ldquo;My poor little Beela! I
      <i>know</i> she&rsquo;s a madcap, but she is good, she is kind. She <i>had</i>
      to be a boy. I <i>made</i> her be one. She couldn&rsquo;t have done what she did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala, please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;-unless she <i>was</i> a boy. And now she is shamed and
      humiliated! Don&rsquo;t let my sweet sister ever know that. It would break her
      heart. Poor little Beela!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all wrong. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even for <i>my</i> sake you might be generous. It is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three strides brought me to her, and I was unconscious of the power in my
      angry grip on her wrist, but her tongue went silent. She raised her eyes
      under the compulsion of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s matching of our forces. A ripple of mischievous and
      innocent surprise animated her, and she laughed with the glee of a gentle
      child. She was very much like her sister then.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deepening thunder-crash came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go&mdash;now! I&rsquo;m going with you. I won&rsquo;t let you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go,&rdquo; I firmly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i>. I <i>want</i> to. I&rsquo;ll get a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lentala. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was turning away, I saw the second time in her face the look of one
      whose road has stopped at a wall. When I smiled and bowed to her as
      Christopher and I were passing out, she was standing where I left her,
      looking blankly at me.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE drenching,
      thunder-ridden storm was so favoring that I determined to investigate Mr.
      Vancouver&rsquo;s circumstances, and, if possible, ascertain the plans focusing
      in him; for since the discovery of Beela&rsquo;s sex, her horror and timidity
      concerning those intentions were explained. I must now take the lead,
      since the work was not fitted to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      No guards were outside Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s hut when we arrived, and the
      wetting of the ground silenced our footfalls. My impulse was to enter, and
      cautiously ascertain the truth; but I realized that the risk was great. In
      creeping round the hut we overheard two native men talking near the rear
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; continued one of the voices. &ldquo;He is groaning again, and may wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a little while the other remarked, &ldquo;He is asleep. What were you telling
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is very uneasy. The people all know that the white man is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there dry wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is stored in a thatch hut on the east side of the clearing. The
      people are clamoring for the white man to be taken to the stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be done while the storm rages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but the first hurricane never lasts long. The king has promised Gato
      that the white man shall be sent to the fire as soon as this storm passes.
      That may be tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the white man suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. He frets and groans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are these stories about the Black Face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scouts sent by Gato say that it looks more ferocious than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the king realize that the people will rise unless he consents to the
      offering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He is silent and deeply troubled. Danger stops any
      direction that he can take. But Gato is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A horror that I felt rather than understood came over me, and, fearing
      that I should betray our presence by some rash act, I was creeping away,
      when I discovered that Christopher, moving similarly, had started before
      me. Every tree-branch was a tempting club with which to break a savage
      head and free the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of returning to our hut, we went to the summit of the wall
      enclosing our valley. Clearly Christopher required no explanation to
      understand my purpose. With slow, sure caution we took an eastwardly
      course, parallel with the brink of the precipice and at a safe distance
      from any men that might be patrolling it. From time to time we would stop,
      creep nearer the edge, make a careful inspection, return in silence, and
      go on. The violence of the storm abated somewhat, thus making our progress
      swifter, but more risky.
    </p>
    <p>
      With true instinct Christopher went straight to what we had been seeking,&mdash;the
      opening in the forest on the top of the wall fronting the Face. The clear
      space was smooth, level rock. One segment of the nearly circular opening
      was cut off by the sheer drop of the precipice. Near that edge was an
      exquisitely built circular stone platform some four feet high and ten in
      diameter. As we worked round for a nearer view, we discovered on its top
      old marks of fire which the rains had not washed off. I recognized it as
      the object that I had seen from the valley, opposite the Face. There was a
      moon, but only a faint glow from it filtered through the clouds;
      occasional flashes of lightning gave us clearer seeing. The air was
      stifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We edged nearer to the cliff, and stood peering across the valley as we
      waited for light. It came, and revealed the Face. The sodden, sordid,
      worse than bestial mask, more repulsive than ever in the gloom of the
      storm, held its gaze fixed upon us. We were upon the scene of the
      unthinkable tragedy awaiting Mr. Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      We circled the eastern edge of the clearing. Soon we found a squat
      structure of thatch, half hidden in the edge of the forest. It was filled
      with neatly piled firewood. No surprise showed in Christopher&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After further exploration of the vicinity, and satisfied that the place
      was unguarded, we loaded ourselves with wood from the hut, and plunged
      into the thicket. A short distance away I had discovered a deep cleft. We
      threw our loads into it; the fall was long before the sound came from the
      bottom. Thus, after many trips, we disposed of all the fuel, and hastened
      back to our hut for sleep. The night was far gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm broke afresh, and I lay sleepless, and listened to the elemental
      furies at play. Every nerve ached, and sleep was a sore need.
      Contingencies riding the hurricane would likely offer still heavier work
      for tomorrow. Whatever innocent pranks Beela might indulge, her profound
      seriousness and her appreciation of the dangerous risks in this
      undertaking were genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the swirl and dash of the rain came the roar of the tearing wind and
      the mighty bellow of thunder. Flash, peal, and boom rended the firmament.
      Our cabin braced itself and strained under the tug, as though digging its
      claws into the ground to hold firm. Large trees on the slope behind us
      fell crashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was more than a hurricane: it was a tornado; perhaps worse yet, a
      typhoon. Many ships ride out the worst of these; but mentally I saw brown
      men being told off to man the promontories of the bight, and to watch for
      staggering, heart-broken specks on the sea as the wind following the
      hurricane urged them on slowly to a pleasant beach, five hundred
      swordsmen, an oily savage king and a feast, and a march over the mountain
      to a guarded paradise; thence to be &ldquo;sent away&rdquo; to their homes&mdash;their
      eternal homes&mdash;one at a time! one at a time! So far as civilization
      had reached, it had strangled an unspeakable practice in these seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the churn of the storm in my veins could check the cold that ran
      in my blood. Was the father of Annabel to be only the first? Were we
      waiting as fattening hogs, instead of being out and afield, fighting a way
      to liberty, and dying, if we must, as men should?...
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself off the pallet and rolling on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher?&rdquo; I called, staggering to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew by the nearness of his voice that he was already beside me, but
      invisible in the blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light the lamp. We are going to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed without a word. I was feverishly rummaging for my clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, sir,&rdquo; he said, pointing to my moccasins, but neglecting to fetch
      them to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had forgotten that my dress was Senatra and that moccasins were the only
      part of it I had removed. I made a blundering affair of putting them on,
      for the clutch of my hand was shaped better for a bludgeon just then.
      Christopher was observing me with a mild, exasperating patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put yours on,&rdquo; I roughly commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made still denser the stupidity in his stare, and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, I say! You are going too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! We are going to take Mr. Vancouver away from those beasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a change of expression he made a pretense of preparation. In doing
      so, he edged up to the barred door, placed his wide back against it, and
      calmly faced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; I demanded in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside, Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In exasperation I seized the copper vessel and advanced upon him. Not a
      muscle of his body moved; his ape-like arms hung loose; his hands were
      open. But it was not his defenselessness that stayed me. Far more potent
      was the deep devotion in his eyes, which held a profounder sadness than
      usual. It was a dash of cold water on my heat, but not my determination.
      In all kindness I would reason with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;do you know what they are going to do with Mr.
      Vancouver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He omitted his formula, and simply gazed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told him, in raw, sore words. It was the first time they had been
      spoken by a member of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished at his placidity on hearing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; I had to thunder the question above the outer din.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was listening to sounds that the storm did not make. I waited
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t him, sir, if they get you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re younger &lsquo;n&rsquo; fatter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like most other of Christopher&rsquo;s remarks, this one dealt in a conclusive
      terminal, omitting postulate and explication; but I understood. He had
      told a long and dramatic story in those halting words&mdash;our blind
      assault, our being beaten down and secured, and then the awful end. I
      wondered at that, and longed for the power to see into the working of his
      strangely luminous mind, its far light behind its frontal darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there ain&rsquo;t no dry wood, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last of the ice in my blood broke and ran melting before him. I was
      very tired, and found myself shifting on my feet like a drunken man.
      Tongues of flame began to slip through the hut and dart hither and thither
      with curious dips and turns. Some of them were purple, but the most were
      crimson. A luminous vapor crept in. The boom of a waterfall rumbled; and
      then came a crashing subterranean detonation. Christopher was a gigantic
      ape floundering in a drowning sea of steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; I cried, trying to catch the wall as it swung past.
    </p>
    <p>
      A firm, gentle arm went round me&mdash;an arm of a strength so great that
      my most desperate struggles could not break its hold, yet I was a very
      strong man. Slowly I was borne down on my pallet, and a thin, soothing
      voice came with a hand that tenderly closed my eyes and held the lids
      down. My breathing came easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was daylight, and Christopher was standing in the open door, looking
      out. The rain had ceased, but the morning brightness was smothered under
      the overhead lowering. The pleasant odor of coffee perfumed the hut.
      Without appearing to notice my waking, Christopher served my breakfast,
      but said nothing. A dull lassitude made the straw bed more inviting than
      my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela&rsquo;s cheery good-morning an hour later was checked in alarm when she
      entered and found me prone; but her electric vitality palpitated through
      me and brought me smiling to a sitting posture. Her inquiring look at
      Christopher read nothing in the bland face. A shadow of uneasiness drifted
      through her eyes, but she drove it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are resting. Lie down again.&rdquo; She dropped
      to a seat beside me on the straw, and pushed my head down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&mdash;Choseph.&rdquo; Her hand was on my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the way I talk, Ch&mdash;Dzhoseph?&rdquo; banteringly, stealing
      sly hands to mine and pretending to stare mockingly at me while peering
      into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Beelo. Did you square yourself with the king and have a good
      rest last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Do you think any king&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to see if I&rsquo;m sick. Even though I were dead, your coming would
      bring me to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! Did you hear that, Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sensible man did not answer, nor even look at her. She made a mouth at
      his back, withdrew her hand, and edged away a few inches. Had I made a
      slip after that confidence and caution from Lentala? I roused myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news, little brother? What game and what killing today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell grave. &ldquo;Something has happened with you since I saw you last
      night, Choseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her all, and she held her breath over the audacity of our work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t have dared to suggest it,&rdquo; she said with charming
      helplessness as she gave Christopher and me a look of wondering
      admiration. &ldquo;It was splendid, Choseph!&rdquo; Her dear leaning girlishness, so
      natural and unconscious, started a tumult in me, and it was hard for me to
      keep the deception of her sex at work. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;Mr. Vancouver
      is safe so long as the weather is bad; and when it clears, time will be
      needed to gather dry wood. We&rsquo;ll do nothing for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must be ready,&rdquo; I firmly protested, sitting up. &ldquo;This matter is in
      my hands and Christopher&rsquo;s now, not yours, my lad, for this is work that
      only men can plan and do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The timidity in her look was new, but not less charming than her
      surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do, Choseph?&rdquo; she inquired with a mocking
      exaggeration of a helpless reliance that was quite genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be ready to take Mr. Vancouver by stealth or force the moment
      that actual danger comes near him. We will bring him to this hut and hide
      him here. But a man from the colony will be needed to guard him. I am
      going immediately to bring one out for that purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes kindled with alarm. &ldquo;No, no, Choseph! That would be impossible.
      You couldn&rsquo;t find the way nor pass the guard. I will go.&rdquo; Argument and
      persuasion were equally useless; she knew when to be firm. &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo;
       was her answer to everything, and she came to her feet. &ldquo;You and
      Christopher come with me to the summit of the wall, and there you&rsquo;ll hide
      near the guard, and wait. I&rsquo;ll bring the man nearly to the place and send
      him ahead, and give you a signal. You must trick the guard out of the way,
      and meet him; I will follow. It would ruin everything for me to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed, and told her to bring Hobart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you understand that we have accomplished one of the
      tasks for which you brought us out of the valley, and in doing so have
      learned the fate awaiting our colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face at once grew pinched. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, Choseph!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know whether you have or not, and I don&rsquo;t know what is in your mind.
      Simply think of saving Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dear lad,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;but we must be planning also for means
      to leave the island, since only something awful awaits us here. You must
      tell me all that I should know. I won&rsquo;t dance any longer to your mysteries
      and concealments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as though I had struck her. She stared, her eyes flooding, her lips
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;there are things that you must see and hear for
      yourself, and they will come tonight and tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll take you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know now,&rdquo; I demanded, not realizing the harshness of my tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to me, sir?&rdquo; came from Christopher, standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Christopher. We&rsquo;ll wait, dear little brother.&rdquo; The sunshine came
      swimming into her eyes again, and she made a grimace of triumph in which
      was an understanding that Christopher had disciplined me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be good now, won&rsquo;t you, Choseph?&rdquo; It was said in her most teasing
      manner, and I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started under an angry sky through which heavy cloud-masses tumbled. It
      was a cautious journey. The very air seemed filled with expectancy. On the
      way we formulated a plan for tricking the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In approaching the point of egress from the valley, Beela practiced the
      slyness of a lynx and the silence of a serpent. Every step was studied
      lest a twig snap; the leaves on the ground had been softened by the rain.
      Presently we sighted the guard&mdash;a draggled lot, unused to exposure
      and dispirited by the weather. There Beela left us in hiding. I now
      understood the perils that she had breasted in every trip to the valley.
      If they were so difficult under these conditions, how much more they must
      have been when fair weather made the guard alert and the ground noisy
      under foot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela was to warn us of Hobart&rsquo;s coming by giving a certain bird-call
      thrice. Christopher&rsquo;s answering signal would be notice to Beela that
      Hobart was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savages, not twenty paces away&mdash;at least two dozen stalwart men&mdash;were
      variously squatting, sitting, and lounging. They were in a compact group,
      and were talking in low voices, but with an animation unusual to the race.
      I motioned Christopher to follow, and we crept nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some important news had just been brought by the relief guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the king isn&rsquo;t going to wait for night,&rdquo; said one, as though the
      news was surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;He fears that the ground will shake at
      any time. Besides, the storm will likely come again tonight, and the great
      fire would be impossible then.&rdquo;

      <i>How We Outwitted the Guard. A Sword Encounter With a Native. Rawley
      Gives Me a Sensational Surprise. The Tragedy to Mr. Vancouver Delayed</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WAS absorbed in
      conjuring up plans for Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s rescue; but the more I thought of
      it, the madder the undertaking seemed. Suppose we should take him; would
      not the whole island swarm in a search?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had calculated that Beela and Hobart should come in four hours. More
      than half that time was already gone when Christopher and I returned to
      our original hiding-place. That the storm, the Black Face, and Mr.
      Vancouver&rsquo;s fate were interwoven, there could be no doubt. Barring
      hindering contingencies, matters were rapidly drawing to a crisis. If the
      necessity for urgent action on Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s account should arise before
      Beela&rsquo;s return with Hobart, that young man would be caught in a trap, as
      there would be none but savages to meet him. In whatsoever direction I
      turned, many chances for a fatal slip and added complications appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solution of one branch of the problem crept out of the strain,&mdash;that
      of clearing the way for Hobart. I mentioned it to Christopher, and was
      gratified at his acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We <i>have</i> to wait for <i>her</i>, sir,&rdquo; he answered after listening,
      and his manner was final.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triple bird-note came. We waited. It was repeated. I slipped round to
      the trail used by the guard, and openly approached them. They stared at me
      in silence. Beela had told me that in an emergency Christopher and I, to
      explain peculiarities of our appearance that no disguise could conceal,
      should explain that we were from the western end of the island, where some
      white blood had mingled with the native, producing, with other deviations
      from the normal type, men of a more aggressive and daring disposition,
      which gave them an advantage over the natives at this end, and that on
      occasion the king called on the western men for special services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you done your duty?&rdquo; I sternly demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard showed only dull surprise, none either moving or speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen the Black Face scowling?&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Go immediately and
      attend to your duty, or the Face won&rsquo;t wait for a white man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were impressed and frightened. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean the stone in the clearing, and so make it ready. Every one of you
      go, at once. Then come back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked from one to another, bewildered, the order evidently being
      extraordinary. &ldquo;And leave the pass unguarded?&rdquo; the same one inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not here? Go immediately!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Gato send you?&rdquo; asked a big fellow, advancing, sword in hand. His
      weapon was held threateningly, and scraped the bushes as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not daring to take any chances with him, and not having had sufficient
      experience with these people to interpret their motive from their conduct,
      I sprang past him before he could raise his weapon, snatched a sword from
      an astonished native, backed away to keep the crowd before me until I had
      faced the one who had advanced upon me, and went at him with a
      determination that opened his eyes and instinctively brought his sword to
      guard. I discovered that the sword which I held was a heavy affair, broad
      and very old-fashioned. Before my inexpert antagonist knew what had
      happened, my sword had twisted his from his grasp and sent it flying into
      the bushes, and my point was at his breast. There was an excited movement
      in the crowd, but before anything could be done I loudly said to my
      captive:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good mind to kill you. Take your squad to the clearing at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he hastily agreed, staring at me in wonder, and added, as his
      interest overcame his panic, &ldquo;Are they coming with him soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is neither your affair nor mine. If you don&rsquo;t go instantly I&rsquo;ll
      arrest the entire squad and take you all to the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obediently marched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In returning to Christopher I made a detour, so as to pass the spot where
      Hobart was to appear. I had instructed Christopher to remain a short
      distance away, as it would be easier for one to meet Hobart than two. My
      real reason, which I did not mention to Christopher, was that as a native
      his appearance was one of singular ferocity. I did not wish to run the
      risk of shocking Hobart out of his self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment, Rawley, not Hobart, rose above the edge of the bluff.
      Perhaps my angry exasperation showed in my manner, for Rawley, after a
      startled glance, and seeing me alone, sprang upon me in the moment of my
      hesitation. His leap was swift and stirring, but I avoided him, and began
      to speak in a low voice. It had no effect. Rawley sprang again. I caught
      the violent thrust of his body, and an elbow better trained than he had
      expeded took him in the throat, crashed his teeth together jarringly, and
      sent him reeling and strangling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I again spoke, but he was too dazed to hear, and came at me again, more
      warily, with the glare of killing in his eyes, and still not heeding my
      pacific words. The natural grace with which he began to work for an
      opening gave his feline ease a threat that set me tingling. He was
      desperately in earnest, and my windpipe was his objective. There was no
      falter in his play, which I critically observed as I stood on the
      defensive. And then it came to me that this was neither the madness of
      fear nor the desperation of the cornered coward, but the awakening of that
      ultimate manhood in him which for so long had been held down by an
      artificial life. Even had he not forced me to silence, the game was so
      fine and exciting that I should have been tempted to cease my efforts to
      explain in my desire to see it through.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his leaps were astonishingly clever and he might land at any moment, I
      began to crowd him. While moving to do so, I heard Christopher&rsquo;s signal to
      Beela, but did not pause to see where he was; Rawley also must have heard
      it, for something spurred his activities. In order to save Beela from the
      trap in which he supposed himself to have fallen, he must finish me at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dodged his next spring, but his fingers scraped my throat. Then he found
      himself crushed in my arms. The short blows which he sent into my ribs had
      no effect, but they were delivered with a will. Beela rose above the
      summit, and understood all at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Beela-like, she saw only that it was ridiculous. Without taking the
      trouble to enlighten Rawley, who desisted as soon as he saw her laughing,
      she passed from surprise into unrestrained mirth. Rawley, standing away
      from me, stared at her in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing no sign of Hobart, I sharply inquired in the native tongue where he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason sent this one instead,&rdquo; she answered after finding her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was aghast. &ldquo;What reason did he give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, Choseph. He thought you would understand, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blunder was incredible. Here were Mr. Vancouver and Rawley, the
      arch-enemies of the colony, sent out armed with fresh opportunity for
      destroying us, and we charged with the safety of their lives! The game had
      been sufficiently difficult and dangerous without that. I bitterly
      resented Captain Mason&rsquo;s course. He was aware of the antagonism between
      Rawley and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did Captain Mason send him?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He begged to come, Choseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That staggered me. What had happened to the man to change him so? &ldquo;What
      did he say?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He said little, although he was very much in earnest. On
      the way he said to himself several times, &lsquo;She called me a coward. They
      all think I&rsquo;m a coward.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had come up and was standing placidly by. Of a sudden Rawley
      recognized me as the savage who had visited Mr. Vancouver in the camp. He
      was composed, but had not yet discovered my real identity. A word from
      Beela disclosed Christopher and me to him. It broke in a crash on the
      young man. What reflections were belaboring him I could only guess from
      the shame crimsoning his face. I took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rawley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am sorry that this has happened between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted something that he was trying to stammer by telling Beela how
      I had disposed of the guard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll soon return,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;We must
      leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we must find out first whether they discovered the loss of the
      wood. Several hours would be required to bring up fresh fuel. Don&rsquo;t you
      think it&rsquo;s very interesting, Choseph? My! how solemn you look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her careless insolence tried me, for the peril was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you never had any one to teach you to be serious,&rdquo; I let fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be the funniest thing of all,&rdquo; she returned, amused. &ldquo;Would
      you like to try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sweet archness made me take a half angry, half possessing step
      forward, but a look stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; said she, and we hid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The savages were more animated than before, and they wondered among
      themselves when the white man would be brought up from the settlement, and
      whether all or any of themselves would be relieved from guard duty, that
      they might witness the proceedings. It was clear that they had not missed
      the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We slipped away. When we had come near our hut, Beela asked us to wait
      while she took Rawley to that hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo,&rdquo; I firmly said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand. That man and I cannot live
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded me with a suspicious-looking sadness. &ldquo;Enemies among
      yourselves, Choseph! Is this the best that wise men with so much at stake
      can do?&rdquo; With a smile I took her hand. &ldquo;Thank you, dear little brother,&rdquo; I
      said. &ldquo;I will do my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears easily came to Beela&rsquo;s eyes, and made them moist now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you and Christopher are not to stay here any longer. Wouldn&rsquo;t you
      like to be nearer the beautiful, the good, the angel Lentala?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She darted to the hut with Rawley, and soon returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is to find out the plans for Mr. Vancouver.
      Although the wood is gone, the king won&rsquo;t be balked, and the getting of
      more wood will be but a matter of hours. When we discover that the
      preparations are really afoot, Mr. Vancouver must be taken by you. Before
      that, there is plenty to do.&rdquo; We struck out for the slope overlooking the
      main settlement, and on the way passed near the hut where Mr. Vancouver
      was held. Beela disappeared within and soon returned with the news that
      the threatening weather was holding everything in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoiding roads, we breasted the verdured heights and worked round the
      suburbs. As we mounted, the view expanded. The settlement, embowered among
      trees, made the fairest picture I had ever beheld. I longed to see it
      under the mellow sunshine, which would make its colors more vivid; but
      even without that, the scene was satisfying. It was a considerable city,
      which had grown more by natural accretion than by plan. Broad, tree-lined
      highways with curves instead of right lines swept lengthwise through it.
      Many houses were of stone roughly laid up, and with roofs of mud or
      thatch. Remarkable effects had been secured by use of the native stone in
      its color variations. Of exceeding beauty was a pleasant stream which
      loitered through the settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most conspicuous was the palace of the king, with its accessory buildings
      and walled grounds. Unlike all the other houses, the palace was two
      stories in height, was of great size, and sat in generous grounds enclosed
      with a massive stone wall. I discovered Lentala&rsquo;s quarters; they were in a
      wing. Hamlets with adjoining farms dotted the farther slope and stretched
      up the valley; there were still more, said Beela, in other parts of the
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our further climbing, the ocean rose on the horizon, and a modern
      sea-going vessel sprang up inshore in a harbor at the foot of the
      settlement. My heart leaped as I studied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that, Beelo?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, Choseph,&rdquo; she answered with a bright smile. &ldquo;I was waiting for you
      to find it. That is what is to take your people home if a great earthquake
      comes and we can bring them out of the valley. The king wanted to destroy
      it, but Lentala persuaded him not only to save it, but to put it in order,
      as he might need it some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That she had reserved this precious information for so dramatic a use did
      not impress me at the time. Not till now did I realize that her purely
      feminine instinct for the theatrical made so large a figure in her
      withholdings and revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My throat filled. I seized Christopher&rsquo;s arm and tried to speak, but no
      words issued, and I found that he was already gazing seaward. I had never
      seen in his eyes such wistfulness, so far and deep a vision, as when he
      raised them to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      From him I turned to Beela, and found a look of neglect and expediency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear little brother,&rdquo; I said, and extended my hand; but she pouted, and
      put her arms behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not your dear little brother,&rdquo; she said, her lip trembling. &ldquo;I am a
      savage. You gave your first joy to one of your race.&rdquo; The pain in her face
      was deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, lad.&rdquo; I was very humble, but her swimming eyes were turned
      away, and there was a swelling in her throat. What could I say? how make
      her understand? &ldquo;Beelo, I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be explained,&rdquo; she interrupted, turning sadly away; and we went
      on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, without any visible cause, she was her sunny, mischievous
      self again. I was exceedingly anxious for information,&mdash;what had
      become of the <i>Hope&rsquo;s</i> salvable cargo; whether her seizure by us was
      part of the plan to which we were working. But I had not the courage to
      mention the vessel again, lest pain come to Beela&rsquo;s face. Ever since her
      return from the valley I had been anxious for her report as to any plan of
      action that she had arranged with Captain Mason, and I now conjectured
      that she had deferred it until we should see our vessel. With a blunder in
      tact I had closed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll return and keep an eye on Mr. Vancouver. Do you
      think you know the settlement now and could make your way in the night
      through it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; wondering at her impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you, Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unmistakably she had a very intelligent purpose in thus making us
      acquainted with the topography of the settlement and the presence of our
      vessel. With that idea I began to make a closer study of the approaches
      and thoroughfares, although I could form no conception of means whereby
      the colony might use them against the overwhelming horde of armed natives.
      But Beela&rsquo;s comely head was packed with shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather became more threatening with the approach of evening. At
      night, Beela left us concealed near the prison hut, and went to bring our
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had returned and we had eaten, she suggested that Christopher
      and I go and see the prisoner, and learn all that we could. Gato would not
      be on duty, and the light was dim. Thence we should go to the postern in
      the palace wall, and there be met by her. Then she left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were near the hut a shadow leaped out of the ground, and
      challenged. I answered as Beela had instructed, and the guard stepped
      aside. We entered, and the two natives sitting with the prisoner gave us
      only a glance. In an authoritative manner I bade them wait outside, and
      they obediently went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver was sitting on a stool, his head bowed in dejection, but he
      quickly straightened, and drilled us with a keenly questioning look, in
      which fear, anxiety, and hope were present. It was evident that he was
      profoundly suspicious. He was too shrewd not to see the significance of
      his being kept under guard in a hovel instead of being the king&rsquo;s guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him in Senatra English if he was comfortable. Over his haggard
      face flashed an eager interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; he impatiently answered. &ldquo;I want to know why I am kept
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really expect to see the king?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think you are here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king sent for me&mdash;for a conference.&rdquo; A red light came into his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conference. Suppose he has made up his mind that he can dispose of the
      white people without your help, and that you happen to be first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sallowness that already had entered his face since his imprisonment
      became livid, and the red light flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sent away?&rdquo; he thickly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sent away. That is as good a name for it as any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had ignored Christopher&rsquo;s gentle tug at my sleeve. A quiver ran through
      Mr. Vancouver as if a knife had been slipped between his ribs. It was with
      difficulty that he found breath for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the king know that I can make him incredibly rich from his gold
      and silver and diamond mines? Doesn&rsquo;t he understand that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is as rich as he cares to be. Besides, he has never trusted a
      white man; and why should he trust one that betrays his own friends?&rdquo; I
      could not avoid giving him that thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came weakly to his feet, terror and despair in every line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the king send you to say this?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer. The man sent a wild glance about as though to measure
      his strength with his prison, and to end all doubts quickly by any means.
      Then I saw that his wits were gone, and that the purpose of my talk, which
      was to prepare him for the revelation I had come to make, that he might be
      on his guard, had miscarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher, in the background, edged round, keeping his back, as I kept
      mine, to the feeble light. I could not imagine that Mr. Vancouver,
      desperate though he was, would seize this moment to try issues with his
      fate; but I had not guessed soon enough that the red light meant madness.
      With a choking curse he snatched up his heavy stool and sprang with it
      upraised in both hands to crush me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his leap was ended, a heavy body crashed into him, and two giant
      arms were cracking his joints and sending the stool flying over my head.
      The two guards came running in, but I sent them back. Christopher needed
      no aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pinioned man rolled his head and eyes horribly, and cursed through
      foaming lips. He made futile efforts to sink his teeth into Christopher;
      he kicked wildly; he squirmed like an animal under a strangling hand. But
      Christopher&rsquo;s arms knew the mercy of strength, and he kept dropping
      soothing words. Like a pillar sunk deep in the earth stood Christopher
      while his prisoner gasped curses and put fierce energy into every muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you!&rdquo; he sputtered at me. &ldquo;You are the infernal native dog that
      fooled me and trifled with me in camp. Let me at his throat, you baboon!&rdquo;&mdash;to
      Christopher. &ldquo;Loose me! Let me die with my arms free!&rdquo; He called the king
      and me and all the natives unspeakable names. &ldquo;In decency and mercy,&rdquo; he
      fumed, &ldquo;kill me at once! I know now what you are going to do with me,&mdash;you
      cannibals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher&rsquo;s quieting tongue was as persistent as his arms, and under
      them Mr. Vancouver was gradually breaking down. Christopher assured the
      wretch that no harm would befall him. The man who could resist such
      persuasion would be less than human and worse than mad. Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s
      curses straggled off, his struggles ceased, and the red flame died in his
      eyes. Christopher had coaxed reason back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated Mr. Vancouver, bathed his face, and gave him water to drink.
      With a gentle touch he unlaced and removed the sufferer&rsquo;s shoes, and
      undressed him. The man had become a child in Christopher&rsquo;s hands, and was
      wholly docile when made comfortable in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no personal heed of Christopher in Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s
      yielding; but it evidently occurred to him at last that here was something
      strangely different from the manner of the natives&mdash;something nearer
      and humanly akin. He had been studying Christopher; and when he was
      composed, and Christopher was turning away, Mr. Vancouver seized his arm
      and held him, looking earnestly into his face, and then covering his
      figure with a startled glance. His eyes opened with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Speak low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, disguised like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mason sent us, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save you, sir. Don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver breathed laboredly, and the veins in his forehead bulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was sent with you?&rdquo; he faintly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him, sir,&rdquo; indicating me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the knot come in the suffering man&rsquo;s throat as he rolled his
      bloodshot eyes upon me, half raised himself on his elbow, and stared while
      his breathing rasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; came chokingly, with a clutch on Christopher&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tudor, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spasm caught Mr. Vancouver in the chest, and a rigor ran through him.
      His eyes closed, his head swung back, his mouth fell open, and Christopher
      eased the insensible man down on the pillow.

      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;A Light in the Gloom.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Subtle Changes in Beela. A Startling Discovery in the Palace Vaults.
      The Secrets of the Council Chamber Overheard. Urgent Measures Planned.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU are late!&rdquo;
       blithely greeted Beela when we arrived at the palace gate after leaving
      Mr. Vancouver. &ldquo;That shows how much you think of the beautiful, the angel,
      the sweet, the good Lentala, for you are to sleep in her quarters
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were just in time, for the heavens were opening, and the deluge was at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With great caution Beela conducted us to a chamber in Lentala&rsquo;s wing of
      the palace. Evidently it was a sanctuary, for it was quite different from
      the room in which Lentala had received us, and Beela carelessly remarked
      that in giving us the room, her sister was bestowing a special favor,
      since not even her servants were ever admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Beela chattered on as she lighted the beautiful lamps, &ldquo;this is
      where she comes to lead alone the life that she dreams about, far, far
      away, where there are no Senatras,&mdash;the life that was born in our
      blood, Choseph, and that we can see very dimly, and in our dreams only.
      But this room helps Lentala to dream of it. Do you remember the story you
      told me one day? She has changed the room tonight merely by bringing in
      these couches for you and Christopher to sleep on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt something new in Beela&rsquo;s manner,&mdash;a note of sentiment singing
      low in her voice, an augmented softness and grace in her bearing. She
      appeared to be struggling against it and striving to be the boy Beelo.
      Some success came, but the winning note still sang in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened an adjoining room, and disclosed a bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Senatra tint is a little damaged,&rdquo; she cheerily said. &ldquo;Wash it off;
      you&rsquo;ll not need it tonight. Here&rsquo;s a fresh supply for tomorrow morning.
      Don&rsquo;t forget to put it on! But there&rsquo;s much to do before you sleep. I am
      going to take you to the Council Chamber. Dress as quickly as possible. I
      have to make some changes myself. When you are ready, give three light
      taps on that door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear little brother, but where&rsquo;s Lentala?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala! Do you think she can sit up all night waiting for callers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to see her in the morning, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela had been bustling over finishing touches for our comfort, but my
      question&mdash;perhaps my tone&mdash;stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to see her?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo! Can you ask that? Unless we see Lentala whenever we come to the
      palace, the jungle is more comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, pretending to be hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you don&rsquo;t care for Beelo. It is nothing to sleep under the same
      roof with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Beelo is a part of my life, dear lad. However far away he may be, he
      is always with me. Whenever and wherever I go, my dear little brother&rsquo;s
      hand is in mine; and no matter when or where I sleep, his sweet breath is
      on my cheek; and the touch of his light fingers on my lids and the ring of
      his cheery laugh in my heart wake me in the morning. In my dreams&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       I paused, for Beela embarrassed me by the breathless interest with which
      she was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your dreams, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Beelo comes with another. He leads that one by the hand, and smiles
      at me, and says in his musical voice, &lsquo;This one also you must like, big
      brother, for this is Beelo&rsquo;s best friend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came close and looked up into my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That other one, big brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her breath caught as she moved away, and she was silent for a little while
      as she gave the last touches and started to leave. At the door she threw
      me a mischievous glance, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have funny dreams, Choseph, but I&rsquo;ll tell Lentala you wish to see
      her,&rdquo; and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already observed that no touch of native savagery rested on this
      room. Every article of use or adornment was of a highly civilized
      production. The barbaric splendor of the reception-room was absent here,
      and a dainty, girlish simplicity was the note. Exceedingly charming were
      products of her needlework and other handicraft copied from foreign
      articles. There were some English books that showed signs of hard use. I
      picked up one and found a dainty handkerchief within it, and felt a pity
      for Lentala thus reaching out for what she could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela appeared in different clothes when I rapped, and was much fresher
      and smarter than I had ever seen her. She looked conscious under my
      admiring glance, and expressed gratification at the improvement in my
      looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo, you are as pretty as a girl. Fie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pretended not to hear, and was busy lighting a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all asleep in this wing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go. Listen to the
      storm! Mr. Vancouver is safe for another day, I hope. And still no
      earthquake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a twinge, but no opportunity had offered for my telling her of the
      incident in the hut. The truth is, I dreaded lest she find fault with
      Christopher for disclosing our identity to Mr. Vancouver and my knowledge
      of his perfidy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to say in what lay the finer air of Beela&rsquo;s dress.
      In cut the garments had a masculine approach, but in China they might have
      passed for feminine. The trousers and blouse were of fine dark-blue cloth,
      and were ample. In place of the somewhat shabby straw hat was a becoming
      red turban, and the shoes were Turkish, red, and richly embroidered in
      gold. The blouse opened like a V at the neck, and a negligee tie matching
      in shade the turban and the shoes was secured with a splendid diamond at
      the bottom of the V.
    </p>
    <p>
      More insinuating than these outward things were the girl&rsquo;s gentler voice
      and manner. There was a hint of the young mother in her caressing look and
      touch, and the cello note in her voice had fallen still softer and
      smoother.
    </p>
    <p>
      In lighting the lantern, she disarranged her turban by striking it against
      a piece of furniture. She straightened, and raised her arms to readjust
      it. Her sleeves were wide and open, and they slipped down, baring her
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been trying with all my might to keep from my mind the delicious
      thought of Beelo&rsquo;s metamorphosis, but self-deception was no longer
      possible. I <i>must</i> revel in this new and pleasant experience. The one
      duty that I must observe was the keeping of my promise to Lentala that I
      would not let her little sister know that I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we ready?&rdquo; cheerily asked Beela, picking up the lantern and darkening
      it with a cloth. &ldquo;Come. No talking till I give you leave. We must be
      careful in this wing, for Lentala&rsquo;s servants might wake. The noises of the
      storm will help us, but the veranda is drenched. We must take the other
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door through which she had entered last, and we were in
      darkness when she closed it; but I had dimly seen that it was a corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t use the lantern yet,&rdquo; she whispered, slipping her hand down my
      sleeve to my fingers. &ldquo;Can you find your way, Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There was always something tragic in Christopher&rsquo;s whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me, Christopher?&rdquo; she teasingly asked, squeezing my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required great stoicism for me to hold my hand passive and not return
      the pressure, but I was amazed when she abruptly dropped my fingers. I
      could see nothing except a faint glow through the cloth about the lantern,
      but I peremptorily seized her sleeve, drew her arm up, took her hand, and
      squeezed it hard, for reproof. She made no resistance. Beela was very
      sweet in the dark,&mdash;I remembered the passage through the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We almost immediately turned into a much longer stretch, as I knew by the
      whispering echoes of our steps; and soon the shrouded light of Beela&rsquo;s
      lantern made the walls visible. After leading us down a dark stair she
      halted before a door, unlocked it, ushered us within, relocked the door,
      and removed the cloth from the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chamber was a disordered lumber-room, filled with odds and ends of
      broken things, native and foreign. I was less interested in the rubbish
      than in the new picture of Beela in the ascending light from the lantern.
      It made a witchery of her chin, emphasized the graceful curve of her lips,
      filled her delicate nostrils, and threw her eyes into mystical shadow. I
      tried to get her hand again, but failed. Beela in the light was not the
      same as Beela in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are safe for a while now,&rdquo; she said. It was hard to listen composedly
      to her words, so sweet was the tone of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wound and twisted through the stores, we following, and brought up at
      a door which a stranger, likely, never would have found. This she
      unlocked, passed us through, and secured behind us. The air was dank and
      musty, and despite the lantern there were uncanny patches of
      phosphorescent light on walls otherwise invisible as yet. The space was
      roomy, the floor earthen. It proved to be a large cellar-like chamber with
      a low ceiling supported by stone pillars groined into arches, and was
      paved, furnished with grated windows, and sweet and dry. Here were immense
      stores: American-tinned provisions in astonishing abundance; bale upon
      bale of cloth of many kinds; modern farming implements, and machinery and
      tools for sawyers, carpenters, cabinet-makers, upholsterers, and many
      other useful trades; and at one side an array of firearms and ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela was watching me in my astonishment, for not the smallest item of
      this store had I seen in use by the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what it all is, Choseph?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the cargo of your vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was speechless. Two things were clear: one, that the water-tight
      bulkheads in the Hope had not given way (which accounted for her pursuit
      of us instead of sinking), and the other, that the natives had carefully
      repaired all the water-damage possible. The thorough care of the cargo
      very likely had extended to the vessel herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My emotion was profound. I wrung Beela&rsquo;s hand, but something in my eyes
      made her dim and floating. Only vaguely could I see the sweet uplift and
      happiness in her face. Christopher was standing apart like a man of wood
      except that his eyes were living. If he needed any expression from me of
      the almost cruel joy that filled me, he gave no sign, but stood in the
      pathetic loneliness that forever invested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go on,&rdquo; said Beela. &ldquo;It is time for the king&rsquo;s privy council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A devious way through another storage vault filled with things no doubt of
      great value, the ascent of a stone stair, a turning into this passage and
      another into that, and a short flight of steps, brought us at last upon a
      curtained balcony overlooking a dimly lighted council hall of considerable
      size and rich in savage appointments. The king was on a throne facing us,
      and in a semi-circle before him, seated on rugs on the stone floor, were
      old and elderly native men splendidly appareled. The king was even more
      sumptuously robed than on the day of our reception by him. He had no
      personal attendants, for this, Beela explained in a whisper, was not a
      state council, but a secret one, called occasionally for extraordinary
      purposes, composed of selected wise men, and generally held late at night.
      The balcony where we sat was for the use of the queen and her feminine
      friends at state meetings. The diaphanous curtains, of an exquisite native
      texture and handsomely embroidered, could be seen through from our side,
      which was in shadow, but not from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing had been puzzling me exceedingly. It was that no American and
      European articles looted from wrecks were in use in their original form by
      any of the natives except Lentala and Beela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Beela had told me in answer to my question, &ldquo;the natives don&rsquo;t
      need them, and are more content without them. The king is wise with his
      people, and they love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The council was under way. An old man had been droning something that I
      did not hear, for his voice was weak and the storm noisy. The king nodded
      to another, a younger man, who came to his splendid full height. His
      gold-embroidered cloak of office slipped from his great right shoulder and
      arm after he had risen from his obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the temper of the Senatras, Gato?&rdquo; the king asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very impatient, Sire. There are murmurings and small secret gatherings.
      Rebellion is in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king moved uneasily. &ldquo;And your soldiers?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have them in hand as yet, but they are naturally affected by the
      restlessness among the people, and are sick of waiting and of guarding the
      passes. They have never been on duty so long. They love their homes and
      farms, and they can&rsquo;t understand the delay. If a wreck should come with
      this storm, where will the people from it be held?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is plenty of room in the valley,&rdquo; snapped the king, making an
      impatient gesture. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t our people know that the crowd we have there
      is different from any castaways we have had before? Of course we can&rsquo;t let
      any of them leave the island, for they suspect its wealth, and would
      return with soldiers and guns, and destroy us. But we have to proceed
      cautiously. There are more than a hundred and fifty picked men in the
      party, and their leaders, Mason and Tudor, and the giant ape Christopher,
      are shrewd, bold men, and have no fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We three were sitting close together, Beela in the middle. One of her
      hands stole out, took Christopher&rsquo;s, squeezed it, and released it. The
      other found my hand; I closed on its warm softness and kept it prisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some mysterious way,&rdquo; Gato explained, &ldquo;they have outwitted us. Our
      plan was to break them up by using the old traitor Vancouver, but they
      evidently discovered his treachery, and I have just learned that they sent
      him out as our first offering to the Black Face, while letting him think
      that he was going to betray them to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that he is as good as another for the
      sacrifice. That will satisfy the people for a time, but he is the first
      and the last that we&rsquo;ll get from that crowd without bloody work, and I
      don&rsquo;t wish my subjects to be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the others waited. Beela&rsquo;s breathing had grown quick; there
      was a slight quiver in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mason evidently suspects that the people taken out of the valley will not
      be sent away, and so he is holding them together. No doubt they have armed
      themselves, and are ready to fight. Mason will be in no hurry to
      precipitate an issue with us, for they can subsist indefinitely where they
      are, we can&rsquo;t strengthen our position against them, and time, he reasons,
      may bring me to liberate them in a body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible not to recognize the kindliness and benevolence in the
      king&rsquo;s voice and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I speak, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that Vancouver is going mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king looked his dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He mumbles,&rdquo; proceeded Gato; &ldquo;his eyes are wild at times; he calls for
      his daughter, and weeps like a child; he cannot eat, and his sleep is
      broken with loud cries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much of that?&rdquo; the king asked in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire; only rarely. If he is taken to the sacrificial altar when he
      has a lucid period,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The risk is great,&rdquo; groaned the king. &ldquo;The people would resent the
      offering up of a madman; and we can do nothing while the storm lasts. The
      people can&rsquo;t assemble. We must wait. You men go among the Senatras
      tomorrow and pacify them. Tell them that all will be well. Do they say
      that the Face is threatening, Gato?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire. Some fools have seen it and spread tales about it. One is that
      green water streams out of its eyes, and another is that the mouth has
      opened and that purple flames come forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela&rsquo;s start thrilled me. The news brought the king to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Gato,&mdash;the open mouth and the purple flame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Sire. I have not seen it, and I do not believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it may be true! Find out tomorrow morning, and let me know.&rdquo; He was
      leaving the throne, and although the light was poor, I could see a totter
      in his step and haggardness in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others were rising. The king turned to them, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>that</i> is true,&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, but stood in a daze.
      &ldquo;The council is ended,&rdquo; he weakly added, and slowly left the chamber, the
      others filing after him.

      <i>Lentala&rsquo;s Odd Mistake. Beela Finds Me Refractory. The Deep-Laid Plan of
      Gato. Christopher and I Charged With Service to the Old King</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>LEEP held away
      that night. The revelations of the privy council had been startling. Some
      things were clear. One was that the king was a shrewd, easy-going, kindly
      man, vastly wiser than his subjects, and finding it simpler to rule them
      by pampering their superstitions than by raising them to his own
      understanding. Another was that he felt himself on the edge of a crisis,
      saw no way to avert a possible catastrophe, and was facing it with a
      paralyzing dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lentala, fresh and radiant, brought our breakfast. Except for her color,
      not a trace of savagery remained about her. Her dress was a simple
      house-frock of fine white linen, and of a modern style. Her hair was done
      exactly like Annabel&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not improve her appearance. Had she been white, there would have
      been no touch of the incongruous. But in this fresh, sweet daintiness,
      much of her savage splendor had been sunk, and I felt a keen
      disappointment. The former Lentala, for all her barbarity, had never
      seemed an alien, but more a bringing back to me of a deeply rooted
      principle fundamental in my heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to expect a compliment; but how could I be otherwise than
      sincere with her? Our greetings were pleasant; yet her clothes had set a
      constraint between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like my dress, Mr. Tudor?&rdquo; she ruefully asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is exquisite, Lentala, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made it all myself, from a picture in a book out of your ship! I
      thought you would like it. Doesn&rsquo;t Annabel dress this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but in the native dress your beautiful, rich color&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I
      paused in my floundering for a delicate way in which to say it. &ldquo;Annabel
      is white, you know,&rdquo; I blundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreseeing my explanation, she had turned flutteringly away before my
      final words came, and was still holding the empty copper tray on which she
      had brought our breakfast. It fell with a clatter; her back was turned to
      me when she picked it up in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A white woman!&rdquo; She did not look at me. &ldquo;Yes, she can wear dainty things
      and be sweet; but a brown savage woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had risen from my seat at the table and was advancing toward her. She
      turned and faced me defiantly, backing away, her eyes flashing. In another
      second, with a lightning change which showed her near kinship with Beela,
      she smiled sweetly, and asked with a dash of her old coquetry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like Lentala better if she were white and pink like Annabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I like Lentala white more than Lentala brown, since, first and
      last, it is Lentala that I like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She frowned comically in an effort to puzzle some sense out of that
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; I added, laughing at her perplexity, &ldquo;that I like Lentala
      because she is Lentala, not because she isn&rsquo;t some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was another poser, and she made just such a little wry face over it
      as I had seen Beela make many a time. Her face brightened as she made a
      dash at a short cut out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like me <i>because</i> I&rsquo;m brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question! It isn&rsquo;t because you aren&rsquo;t white that I like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Could</i> you like me if I were white?&rdquo; She stamped impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to,&rdquo; I sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little pout, stuck up her chin, turned stiffly, and went out
      with great dignity. It was the Lentala of the feast!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela entered when we had finished breakfast. In her rough clothes and
      tightly bound hair, she made so sharp a contrast to Lentala that, for a
      moment, I could not think of her as a girl, but as the dear lad whom I had
      lost. She had none of her brilliant sparkle now, and my heart ached to see
      the weariness and anxiety that she tried so bravely to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s afoot for today, dear little brother?&rdquo; I cheerily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was regarding me solemnly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your wish, I suppose. You&rsquo;ve
      seen Lentala this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She brought our breakfast. She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Beela was bored. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her. She looked a fright in those
      clothes. Trying to ape Annabel! She ought to have better sense. I know you
      were disgusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk! I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired and cross this morning, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flopped into a chair, very glum. &ldquo;Women are <i>such</i> fools!&rdquo; she
      grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am grieved to learn that Lentala is not a woman, for she could
      never be a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela looked at me with sad reproach, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;she was a rich red rose sparkling with morning
      dew. Her smile started all the birds to singing. She&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; She stamped the floor, much as Lentala had done, but a smile
      fringed her frown. &ldquo;You <i>know</i> she made a fright of herself trying to
      look like Annabel,&mdash;and with that ugly brown face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Beelo. The only trouble was that Lentala is too modest to realize
      how splendidly perfect she is as Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t she still Lentala in those silly clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was as much less Lentala as her effort to be something else succeeded
      in making her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela looked puzzled exactly as Lentala had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her heart is broken!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;She says that you laughed at her,
      and spoke in riddles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laughed <i>with</i> her, Beelo, not <i>at</i> her; and the riddles were
      a bit that I put in my mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The temptation to say beautiful things to Lentala that might sound
      insincere is strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, with a confusion that was half amusement, and tried to hide the
      light in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Choseph! There is much to do today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Lentala first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not mistake my seriousness. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have her unhappy over that trifling incident. She is too
      sensitive,&mdash;she misunderstood. I must see her, lad.&rdquo; I started for
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; came breathlessly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me that way!&rdquo; she exclaimed in genuine alarm. Christopher
      was moving round toward the door for which I had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As though&mdash;as though you&rsquo;d break down doors and kill anybody that
      stood in your way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t! She&mdash;she&rsquo;s undressed. I&rsquo;ll tell her. She&rsquo;ll be
      satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, lad? Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began making some preparations about the room. &ldquo;You ought to be kept
      tied, Choseph,&rdquo; she said, half to herself. &ldquo;I never know what you are
      going to do next.&rdquo; Yet a sweet note in her voice sounded low.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came and stood before me, looking me straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to give you and Christopher very delicate and important work
      to do this morning, Choseph, but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll do something rash and
      ruin us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt the sting. &ldquo;Trust me, little brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head in trouble. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sly, Choseph; you&rsquo;re not
      cunning and patient. Those are what are needed now. You have enough
      courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to meet King Rangan, Choseph, and you are to do everything that
      he wishes you to do. You may think you ought not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say that I ought, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do say so. If you refuse, or show temper, or do anything that a Senatra
      wouldn&rsquo;t do, all is lost. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a fool, Beelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph! That was temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, lad,&rdquo; I begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very dangerous work&mdash;terribly so if you make a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is much broken. He is growing old, and the problem of the colony
      is wearing on him. Choseph, will you think of him as kind and gentle, and
      as meaning well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you watch Christopher? Sometimes he understands more than you or
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Beela was much relieved. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll explain. The king is
      failing rapidly. He needs such friends as you and Christopher, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such friends as <i>we</i>, when he is holding us as fattening cattle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; Beela&rsquo;s voice rang sharp, and she angrily stamped. Then came a
      hopeless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her hands. &ldquo;Come, dear friend,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;That was the last. I am
      wholly in your hands. And remember, there is always Christopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away with a sigh, and began to put finishing touches to our
      efforts at the restoration of neatness in the room. She was evidently
      gathering herself, for presently she came and took a seat facing me,
      Christopher standing. Her manner was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the case,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;The king has meant always to be kind to
      Lentala and me, and we are grateful. We love the queen dearly. We would
      lay down our lives before permitting any harm to befall them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her emotion made her pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious dangers are threatening them now,&mdash;more than they suspect,&mdash;and
      these have come because of your people. Before that, only one or two would
      be cast up from the wrecks. They gave no trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horror came into her face, and she looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always supposed that they were sent off,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;Never once did
      I suspect the truth until shortly before your party came, and then my
      affection for the king died in me, and I was sick at heart. I don&rsquo;t think
      the queen knows the truth to this day. I think the king would have stopped
      it long ago, but for Gato, who wanted to use it to keep the natives in
      savagery. He is a bad man, with great power. When your large party came,
      he saw a way to break the king, stir the people to rebellion, kill the
      king and queen, and take the throne himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Gato suspect that you know this about him?&rdquo; I asked in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There is where our safety lies. I never should have suspected him if
      he hadn&rsquo;t made love to Lentala and told her that if she would marry him
      she would soon be queen,&mdash;the beast! Then we watched and found out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a thoughtful pause she proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gato is secretly stirring up the people. I have no doubt that he is about
      ready to strike. His plan will be this, I think: The palace guard are men
      whom he can trust to do his work; he will kill everybody here, and then
      take the army into your valley and slaughter all but a few. He will keep
      those for the sacrifices. It was he that induced the king to use Mr.
      Vancouver as your traitor. But, unlike the king, he doesn&rsquo;t care how many
      natives might be killed in a fight with the colony when he has made
      himself king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was regarding me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are Christopher and I to do?&rdquo; I cheerfully asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you some things before that,&rdquo; she answered, but with
      hesitancy. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be hurt with me, Choseph, and you won&rsquo;t be angry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly not, dear lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Captain Mason all these things when I went into the valley the
      last time.&rdquo; She waited anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad of that,&rdquo; I brightly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was much relieved, and with a sudden dash came over and squeezed my
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really my dear big brother!&rdquo; she said, and demurely resumed her
      seat. &ldquo;I told him something else,&rdquo; she went on with more confidence. &ldquo;It
      was to have his entire colony ready to move at a moment&rsquo;s notice,&mdash;not
      to bring anything with them, except all the food they could carry, but to
      be prepared at any time of the day or night to march in perfect silence
      out of the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the ship!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;I advised him to pick some cool, trustworthy men to take
      charge of the march.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he already had his men chosen, and was glad that Hobart didn&rsquo;t have
      to come out with me. He said it would be the making of Rawley to come, and
      that you would understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did at last. There was something almost magical in Captain Mason&rsquo;s
      ability to dig the manhood out of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for your work and Christopher&rsquo;s,&rdquo; resumed Beela. &ldquo;I will take you
      to the king as English-speaking natives from the mountains beyond the
      valley on the west, which you have not seen. As I have told you, the
      natives there are wilder and fiercer than these, have little intercourse
      with them, and are largely independent. Their blood has mingled with that
      of a few castaways, and they are brighter. On this side is the ancient
      race, simple, gentle, dull. The king is proud of it, and wishes to keep it
      pure. But he will welcome the other men in this emergency, particularly if
      they speak English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he full confidence in Gato?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is growing suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to be the king&rsquo;s confidential agents; to find out, independently
      of Gato, all that is afoot; to be ready to protect the king; and
      especially to treat with the colony if any trouble should rise from that
      source. Is it all clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly. We are to guard the king and maintain his authority at any cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela studied me uneasily. &ldquo;Yes, at any cost,&rdquo; she slowly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of Gato,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;We are to resort to any measures
      with him, however extreme, if we have good reason to think them
      necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; somewhat anxiously. &ldquo;What do you mean, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything that may be wise and prudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced down. She made no reply, but gave this warning, still not
      looking up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take no chances with him. When you strike, which you must, sooner or
      later, let the blow be swift and sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of the army when he is out of the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question troubled her. &ldquo;It is very uncertain,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There
      may be leaders under him who are in his confidence. They or one of them
      may take command and lead the army against the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet and glanced about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the king at once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lentala told him about you and
      promised to have you there by this time. I fear that Gato has already
      returned with his report of the Face with its open mouth and purple
      flame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one thing, dear lad,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;I wish to see Lentala first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her adaptability was as quick as a child&rsquo;s. The seriousness which she had
      worn flashed into a teasing quirk of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph,&rdquo; she said, solemnly wagging her head at me, &ldquo;how can you think
      of girls at such a time as this? Lentala would have too much sense to see
      you now. Come with me to the king.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;To the Rescue of the King.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Our Risky Audience With His Majesty. He Encoils Us in Allegiance. I
      Open His Eyes. Gato&rsquo;s Scheme of Regicide. A Bold Act by Christopher.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ON our way to the royal apartments, Beela again took us through the
      vaults. I used the opportunity to fix in my memory the exact places where
      the arms and ammunition from our vessel were kept. The king never
      permitted any of his subjects to handle firearms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard by the vaults she showed us a dungeon. Not within her memory had it
      been occupied, and few, even in the palace, knew of its existence. It was
      an ingeniously designed prison, a grated window for ventilation and a
      little light being so placed that no sound could reach the outside; and
      the door was so deadened that no beating could make a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious that none of the king&rsquo;s attendants should see her, Beela gave us
      directions how to go and what to say and do if we were halted, and slipped
      away, informing us that we might see her face at a small curtained window
      high in the east wall of the room where the king would receive us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another of the attendants whom we encountered on the way eyed us
      curiously and, I thought, suspiciously, and put their heads together after
      we had passed. One of them gave a low whistle; two came forward from in
      front, stopped us, and demanded our identity and business. All these men
      were armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king expects us,&rdquo; was my curt answer; but more effective was our cool
      assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we arrived at the door, which was open, a soldier on guard. More
      peremptorily than the others he demanded our names and errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king expects us,&rdquo; I repeated, and was going within; but the fellow
      laid a hand on me. I flung it off, and so confused him that we were within
      before he could interfere. He mustered some briskness to follow, but was
      too late, for the king had seen us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shocked at his appearance in the clearer light of day. At the feast
      he had looked not far beyond his prime; his eyes were bright then, and he
      bore himself with a commanding dignity. Now he was sinking into
      decrepitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been expecting these men,&rdquo; he said, and the guard withdrew; but I
      knew that he was slyly listening at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made an obeisance. I caught a glimpse of Beela&rsquo;s encouraging face at
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was lounging on a divan; he had been talking with two elderly men
      seated on rugs before him. They regarded us keenly as the king asked them
      to withdraw. When they had gone, Christopher closed and locked the door,
      and stood with his back to it. The surprised and curious scrutiny of the
      king was on him, passing down his grotesque figure. From Christopher he
      turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To serve you, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secretly, by finding out many things, by learning the truth; and in any
      other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have men for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have Lentala also, Sire. She knows that you need us, and that we will
      serve you intelligently, faithfully, and without fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without fear of whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of account has enemies, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I any? I want no guessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Lentala know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not positively, perhaps; but we all love her, and she has many ways of
      learning, since she is not hedged about and kept in the dark as your
      Majesty can be.&rdquo; The king was brightening; a faint eagerness crept into
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you learn to talk in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That inflexion. It isn&rsquo;t pure Senatra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my misfortune, Sire. A long time ago a white man, an American,
      escaped from the natives with the aid of a Senatra girl. She went with him
      into the lonely mountains back of the village Sumanali. There my brother,&rdquo;
       indicating Christopher, &ldquo;and I were born. We speak our father&rsquo;s language
      as well as our mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant something else, also, in your speech,&mdash;a quickness, a
      nimbleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white man was bright and keen, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are not Senatra names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our father was an American, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put me through a further shrewd examination, and I answered readily. It
      was having a slow but conspicuous effect in heartening him. I was
      evidently a new and refreshing element, perhaps bringing hope. He appeared
      satisfied, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any suspicions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what? and of whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might it not be unjust, Sire, to express mere suspicions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected a moment, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Gato?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Black Face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the purple flame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I saw it two days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked he in excitement, sitting erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was slipping along the top of the valley wall, near the Face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s perturbation increased, but he found no wavering of my eyes
      under his sharp gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than that, Sire; my brother and I went into the river passage
      through the wall. We saw the red fire and barely missed a great
      explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s astonishment brought him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me more!&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him an account of all that we had seen and endured, including the
      flaming waterfall, the boiling cauldron, and the earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dared that passage!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking from one to the other of
      us in amazement. &ldquo;It was the white blood. Not another man in the kingdom
      would do it. Gato could not make any of his men go; yet I was anxious to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was saying this partly to himself, as he aimlessly walked the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you go?&rdquo; he abruptly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had heard that no one else was willing, and we wished to serve your
      Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s back being turned, I glanced up at the window. The curtain
      parted for a moment, and Beela&rsquo;s beaming face nodded and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered the king in a profound disturbance, &ldquo;it means that an
      upheaval is at hand,&mdash;and a crisis!&rdquo; He came and stood before me,
      plumping this question at me: &ldquo;Do you fear the Black Face, the flame, and
      the earthquake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least, Sire,&rdquo; I smilingly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the others do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty has not forgotten that our father was white. He taught us
      many wise things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was smitten with a look that seemed to come from his conscience, and
      sank with a groan into the divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I only been as true to my duty, and led my people to the light!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Lentala begged me to. Now I must pay, I must pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I needed no recalling of my pledge to Beela, for pity held me. I looked to
      the window, and the radiance coming thence lighted my wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always hope, Sire,&rdquo; I cheerfully said; &ldquo;we can work and hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a haggard look. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Senatras believe that
      unless sacrifices are made of the white people in the valley there will
      come no more wrecks and castaways, and that the Black Face will therefore
      send the terrible earthquake and eruptions which frighten our people into
      madness, sweep the island with fire, and destroy lives and farms. But how
      can a sacrifice be made? The people think that to offer up a madman would
      infuriate the Face and cause frightful disaster. It is impossible to bring
      another white man from the valley, because the colony would fight rather
      than give him up. Yet unless there is a sacrifice the Senatras will rebel
      through fear of the Face, the army will revolt, my palace will be seized,
      and the queen, Lentala and I, with all our friends and servants, will be
      put to the sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A leader, who must be a traitor, would be required for that, your
      Majesty. That would mean a man of eminence among us; and not that alone,
      but one who has already laid his plans and is ready at this moment to
      strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was staring at me in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak with a deep understanding,&rdquo; he huskily said, &ldquo;and you have more
      to tell me. Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire. The white people wish only to leave the island, and to go in
      peace. They will do no harm if they are not opposed; if they are, they
      will harm only those who oppose them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak with knowledge from my white father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they are permitted to go, they will spread tales of great riches
      here, and destroying ships and armies will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, Sire. In the first place, with such coadjutors as Lentala, my
      brother and I, you could make the island impregnable. That would be far
      wiser than the risk which you are now running, for the sea, even in my
      father&rsquo;s time, was filling with ships, and the great countries were
      hunting new possessions. At any time a ship may come without the aid of
      the storms. She would see this large and beautiful island, and, though
      driven off, would inform her own country, which would send vessels and men
      to overwhelm us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. But would it be possible for us to prepare defenses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our duty to do all that we can, Sire. But there can be an
      additional protection. So long as we keep our present backwardness we
      shall be deemed the rightful prey of any nation. If we aim to be more like
      the great countries, and send ambassadors to them and make treaties with
      them, they will protect us against one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This mightily impressed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds reasonable,&rdquo; he said with a pitiful air of wisdom, &ldquo;but it
      may be attended to hereafter. We are facing a present crisis. You said
      that a leader of an insurrection would be required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The army could put down any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the army itself in revolt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Gato&rsquo;s control of the army is powerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is on the edge of revolt. If Gato is all-powerful with his men,
      and in spite of that fact says he can&rsquo;t control them,&mdash;&mdash;But
      your Majesty is abler than I to draw inferences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king came nervously to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to understand, Sire,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that an ambitious and
      unscrupulous man would see his opportunity when the people are paralyzed
      with fear of the Face or with an outburst of its wrath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opportunity for what?&rdquo; the king demanded. &ldquo;What would he want, Sire? Your
      throne would be a temptation, and so would Lentala to a man who wanted a
      beautiful wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king gripped the edge of a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me for her,&rdquo; the wretched man growled like a lion gnawing a
      bone. &ldquo;I refused him. She is very dear to me. I wanted her to have a
      better man, of her own choosing. For I have provided that she is to rule
      my people when I am gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though greatly surprised, I refrained from looking toward the window, and
      kept silence while the broken man fought out his agony. When the urgency
      of his situation had measurably restored him, he began to pace the floor,
      and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has to be done immediately. What would you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your Majesty understand the case to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on the eve of a revolution. The task is to check it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, Sire, I observe that a score of Gato&rsquo;s soldiers are in the
      palace. Is that customary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stopped and turned a livid look on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Gato suggested that it would be safer to have them here for the
      present as a protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Protection for whom, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hint in the question swept the breath out of him, and he stood
      staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t suspected&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he struggled for breath to begin. Then,
      &ldquo;I see, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The imminence of danger electrified his dormant forces. He hardened and
      expanded, and fighting blood began to run in his veins. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing more, your Majesty. The white people in the valley are
      able, daring, and cunning. Already some of them have escaped and are at
      large in the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he exclaimed in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen them myself, Sire. They are perfectly disguised as natives.&rdquo;
       A quick look at the window showed me a frightened but not a reprimanding
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are positive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they come out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either by tricking Gato&rsquo;s men, or by connivance with some one, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rap at the door prevented further discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Gato,&rdquo; the king whispered. &ldquo;Hide there,&rdquo; pointing to a curtained
      door in the rear wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were immediately concealed. The place was an anteroom. Through the
      curtain we could hear and see everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gato entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo; the king inquired in a friendly, business-like fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is quiet, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the weather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beginning to clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! If the storm has made any wrecks, a castaway for the sacrifice may
      drift ashore. That would restore order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gato solemnly shook his head. The king reclined in silence, and then
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many soldiers have you in and about the palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was surprised. &ldquo;Twenty, Sire,&rdquo; he hesitatingly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send them to the Council Chamber, and summon Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask your Majesty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gato found a look that he was not accustomed to see. It was evident from
      the slowness with which he proceeded to obey that he was alarmed and was
      gaining time for new plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher and I stepped forth when Gato was gone. Beela exhibited some
      fear, but I sent her a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; the king commanded me, &ldquo;observe his manner with his men. You,&rdquo; to
      Christopher, &ldquo;follow him to Lentala and see that no harm befalls her; I
      will show you a way. Don&rsquo;t let him see either of you. Come with me to the
      Council Chamber immediately after the soldiers have assembled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela nodded to me, and dropped the curtain. The king led Christopher into
      the anteroom, gave him hurried directions, opened a door leading out of
      that room, dismissed Christopher, and returned. By this time I was passing
      out, having observed that no one in the corridor was looking toward me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gato had formed his plan, and it contemplated swift execution, as I judged
      from his prompt, incisive manner with his men. In each instance he gave an
      order which I knew from the pantomime included the Council Chamber; then,
      in the man&rsquo;s ear, he added something which brought a start, a stiffening
      of the body, and an unconscious grip of the sword-hilt. As the men were
      straggling past me to assemble, the king leisurely strolled out into the
      corridor, and was sauntering beyond me, when he stopped, turned, and asked
      under his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the signs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has ordered them to kill you in the Council Chamber at a sign from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; The king passed on toward his living-apartments, which he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came quietly walking back, the corridor was clear of soldiers. He
      slipped a modern revolver into my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand its use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I trust your nerve and judgment to use it at the right moment and
      without missing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one shot will settle the matter. If
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be three of us, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, passed on, and turned back. He had become transformed, and
      appeared to look forward eagerly to the crucial moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gato ought to be here with Lentala by this time,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly to the private audience-room, looked in, and strolled
      back. Near me he stopped short, intently listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounded like the roar of an infuriated animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His strolling began again, but with an increasing uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; he said. At intervals he stopped and listened.
      Finally he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent for her,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;to announce that she was heir-apparent to
      the throne, and vested with present authority to take any measures in this
      crisis that would seem proper in her discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know before that my heart could be so touched by such a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His impatience at last slipped control. &ldquo;We will go and see what detains
      them,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started down the corridor. At his own apartments he paused to send a
      servant to the Council Chamber with word that he would soon appear. We had
      gone but a short distance beyond, when we met Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are Lentala and Gato coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the dungeon, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dungeon! Locked up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who put him there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty told me not to let him harm her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm her! Did he try to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there. She wants to see you.&rdquo; He turned to me. &ldquo;And you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We three hastened to her apartments, where we found her lying on a couch
      and attended by a number of frightened women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala!&rdquo; the king anxiously said; &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She forced a smile, held out one hand to the king and the other to me,
      gave mine a quick, tight squeeze, released our hands, in a weak voice bade
      us be seated, and with a wave of her hand dismissed the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, child?&rdquo; the king insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gato came. I was alone. He didn&rsquo;t know that Christopher was behind him.&rdquo;
       She was speaking with difficulty, often pausing. &ldquo;He was impatient. He
      said he loved me and wanted me. And if I wouldn&rsquo;t marry him, he&rsquo;d... he&rsquo;d
      strangle me here and now.... That his men were waiting in the Council
      Chamber to kill you, if I refused him, and then they would kill the
      queen.... I said no. I trusted Christopher. Gato&rsquo;s fingers hooked like
      that,&rdquo; she showed with her own hands, &ldquo;his eyes glared terribly, and he
      came at me.... Christopher crept up, said to me, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t scream,&rsquo; and
      leaped on Gato. They grappled, and rolled on the floor. Gato roared like a
      wild beast.&rdquo; Lentala covered her eyes with her hands. &ldquo;I heard things
      crack and break. I couldn&rsquo;t look. Then came an awful squeak. Christopher
      said again to me, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t scream.&rsquo; It meant he was safe. I felt myself
      falling.... When I saw again, I was lying on this divan, and my women were
      with me. Gato was gone. Christopher was standing in the door. I asked him
      where Gato was. He said, &lsquo;In the dungeon.&rsquo; He would say no more, and I
      sent him for you.&rdquo; She looked at him, and added, &ldquo;Dear old Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo; the king gently asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I&rsquo;m only a little shaken, and will be up in a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like the queen to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It would distress her. Not a word of this to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king led us out. At the door I looked back and won a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went in silence, and the king stepped into his apartments, bidding us
      wait in the corridor a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned a keen look on Christopher, and he met it frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he badly injured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t need no doctor, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he go with you quietly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll hang for this, Christopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king will hang him for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christopher&rsquo;s gaze wandered vacantly round the corridor, and after a while
      he quietly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt him, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth blazed through me. I had been misled by Christopher&rsquo;s perfect
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; I cried, seizing his hand and wringing it; but he looked
      bored.

      <i>Extraordinary Discipline by the King. His Uneasiness Concerning Our
      Loyalty. Lentala&rsquo;s Father. We Must Help Destroy Our Friends. Earthquakes.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LTHOUGH the king
      was greatly shocked when I told him what had really happened to Gato, his
      gratification quickly rose, and he regarded Christopher curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me at once?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not his way, Sire,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;He avoids talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a wonderful thing to do,&rdquo; his Majesty mused as we slowly went to
      the Council Chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had given him a fearful blow, and I guessed it was the danger to
      which Lentala had been exposed. His face was haggard again; his gait was
      unsteady; he doddered and mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we neared the Council Chamber, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and stand near me, one on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found the soldiers in a huddle near the door, the racial dulness of
      their faces somewhat keyed with expectancy. The king gave them but a
      glance as he passed them and ascended the throne,&mdash;to be more
      impressive, no doubt. Christopher and I stood as flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Form a line facing me,&rdquo; the king sternly commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers glanced at one another in wonder as they obeyed, and
      furtively had anxious eyes and ears for Gato. They were a fine crowd,
      selected for courage and dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; the king said, &ldquo;that I am always in supreme command of
      the army, including Gato and every other officer. Any person who may be in
      immediate charge of you is serving as my agent, and is appointed and
      removed by me at my pleasure. All your fealty and loyalty are for me. You
      will now acknowledge that with an obeisance to your king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rascals were dazed. They might send shifting glances down the line if
      they liked, and wonder and waver if they pleased, but obey they must:
      every man felt it in his bones. The line went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etiquette required the maintenance of the posture until the king gave the
      word to rise. The obeisance consisted in coming to the knees, resting the
      elbows, well advanced, on the floor, pressing the palms down, and rooting
      the floor with the forehead,&mdash;an easy performance if quickly
      finished, but a torturing one if sustained. On this occasion the king
      neglected the releasing command; and that was unheard of. In such a
      position the men could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier&rsquo;s first duty,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;is to his king. In becoming a
      soldier he dedicates his manhood, his strength, his life, to his
      sovereign; that is to say, to his country. A true soldier is glad to die
      for the happiness and safety of his king. His duties are as sacred as
      those of a son to his father. A worthy son will remember the protection
      that his father has given him. If he hears him defamed, he will uphold his
      name; if blind, will lead him; if threatened, will defend him though death
      be the reward. So it is with a soldier and his king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice weighted his words with a deep emotion, and he spoke slowly,
      with pauses. It was like listening to a passage from the Bible,&mdash;but
      much better read than commonly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A king may be kind to his soldiers; that will bring him their love with
      their fealty, and give their duty a double force. A king may grow old and
      stand in need of the strong, willing arms of young men whom he loves and
      who love him. A king may totter under the burden of long service to his
      people; his soldiers will then be his stay and comfort, and with joy in
      their hearts will do his high will. Serpents may crawl in the weeds about
      a king&rsquo;s throne: his soldiers will beat the weeds clear of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king could not have failed to see a painful writhing that wormed
      through the line. His pause was long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son who hears even his brother speak ill of their father, will reprove
      the brother and shame him. If that fails, he will chastise his brother if
      he can; but if the brother is stronger, the dutiful one will take the
      matter to their father, since the safeguard of the family is endangered by
      the disaffection of a single member. If a father discovers one of his sons
      jeopardizing the unity, prosperity, and safety of the family, he will give
      the faithless son such treatment as the security of the family demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pause this time was still longer. Meanwhile, the endurance of the men
      had nearly reached an end. Whatever may have been their mental state,
      their physical was one of excruciating pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some men are induced to do wrong through heedlessness or blindness, not
      knowing the gravity of their deeds, and not foreseeing a dire result.
      Others are weak and easily led; they are untrustworthy tools of their
      leaders, and shame is their greatest punishment. Others are cruel and
      wicked at heart; they will therefore be ready to betray the men who led
      them to betray others. All of those are poisonous serpents in the weeds
      about a king&rsquo;s throne. And it is far worse in a soldier than in any one
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After another pause, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A king who is kind and wise will be slow to believe evil of his people.
      It will be natural for him to think that all will be as wise and kind as
      he. Yet he must be watchful; he cannot protect the people unless he
      protects himself. If he finds a scandal, he may hide it, lest it weaken
      the common faith in the strength and purity of his government. If he
      discovers that any are unfaithful, he will not make their treason public
      by hanging them before the people, unless he knows that a warning will
      stop other traitors. No; he will be merciful and keep them privately for a
      time, till they may walk forth erect in their recovered manhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here and there a gasp or a strangled groan broke the silence of the line.
      The king was heeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man at the right of the line will rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow came painfully to his feet, and stretched the agony out of his
      muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advance and lay your sword on the dais,&rdquo; ordered the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to your obeisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A start thrilled the soldier. He gave the king a desperate, pleading look,
      but found eyes with a cold sternness that sent him to obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next, rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The performance was repeated with him, and with the rest in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All rise,&rdquo; said the king. They stood up. &ldquo;I will now take you to a room
      in the palace, where you may consider in quiet what the soldiers of a king
      should be. You,&rdquo; he ordered Christopher, &ldquo;walk beside me at the head, and
      you,&rdquo; to me, &ldquo;follow the soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dignity of a mighty sorrow sat like a grace upon him as he slowly led
      the procession. Never were prisoners more securely manacled with steel
      than these men, though their members were free; and though there was a
      certain pomp in the march, it was that of a funeral, and the silence was
      louder than the blare of much brass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turned into the corridor that led to the vaults, and descended
      the stair. This brought him and the others to the dungeon door. He halted,
      and Christopher unlocked it. It swung wide. The king and Christopher stood
      aside, and the men marched in. Christopher closed and locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;you surely have not forgotten that Gato&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he calmly answered, &ldquo;what they have already endured has made the
      way easier to what they will find in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without haste the king conducted us back to the chamber in which he had
      received us, and seated himself ered: on the divan. He was studying us.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inflated his cheeks and pursed his lips while his goggling eyes roamed,
      and queer wrinkles came and went in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white blood,&rdquo; he grunted, staring at me. &ldquo;It accounts for your
      keenness. The white blood never sleeps. If it is with you, good; if
      against you,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and glared. &ldquo;Which love you the more, son,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;the white
      blood or the brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty sees our color. We came freely and offered our hearts, our
      arms, and our lives to your Majesty. And it is not forgotten, Sire, that
      Lentala sent us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; The growl died in him, and he brightened. With both hands he
      clutched the edge of the couch. &ldquo;It takes white blood to fight white
      blood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did your father tell you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I recall, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black blood and red blood and yellow blood and brown blood always fall
      before it, soon or late. He said nothing about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father told me much of the great world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he told you that. And I know. I saw it when I went abroad in my
      youth. I learned it from Lentala&rsquo;s father. Does it mean anything to you
      that your mother was a Senatra?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sufficient that your Majesty and Lentala are Senatras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king fixed a keen stare on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mention Lentala very often,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She indorsed us to your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something more is here. That is the white blood in her. In you and in her
      the white blood knows its own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sudden confirmation of my surmise concerning Lentala choked the words
      in my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; he roughly demanded. &ldquo;Is it not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only gaze at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white blood finds and knows its own,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Two hundred and
      fifty of those with white blood are held on this island by a great horde
      of those with brown blood. I need a man of the white-blood shrewdness and
      boldness and courage to manage those two hundred and fifty to the safety
      of my people and my island. But if I take a man with white blood in his
      veins, it will side with the white blood that threatens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Lentala hand over to treason and destruction your Majesty and the
      queen and all the other Senatras whom she loves, and the people to whom
      she belongs and the country that has nourished her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wittingly, for she is a daughter of the gods; but the blood, my son,
      the blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, a love early planted endures forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to fight his despair, and walked up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Lentala has proved it. I spared her
      father, a castaway, because he stopped a great plague that was destroying
      my people. I myself was stricken, and he saved my life I feared him
      because he was of the white blood, and because of his wisdom and power. He
      held the secrets of the gods, and had no fear. I had planted deep in my
      people a hatred of the white blood; and I required that he not only
      disguise himself as a native, but remain within the palace grounds. He
      taught me many things, but I refused to follow his advice to instruct my
      subjects. He educated Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he still alive?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died two years ago. If he were only here now! We became strong
      friends. Lentala&rsquo;s devotion to the islanders is returned by them almost as
      idolatry. I know how the white blood can love, but I know also how it can
      hate; and it knows its own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly halted, and wheeled upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;that some of the white men are at large on the
      island. What mischief are they doing? What mines digging under me? My
      people are children,&mdash;I have kept them so, God help them! I need not
      alone a wit and a daring to match the white people&rsquo;s, but Senatra devotion
      as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty knows Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blazed on me. &ldquo;Do you love Lentala?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fierce tingling raced through me, and dumbness held me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is beautiful and sweet,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;She is steadfast; she is brave
      and able. There never was a woman to match her. You are big and strong and
      brave. She found you. Like finds like. Do you love her as a man loves a
      woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fought blindly for wit and words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire,&rdquo; came the thin, even voice of Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      We both turned in surprise. He beamed on us blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she love him as a woman loves a man?&rdquo; the king asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His audacity held me speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can trust her&mdash;and you,&rdquo; the king said to me,&mdash;&ldquo;so far as
      blood tempered by love and loyalty may be trusted, which is farther than
      it may trust itself. I am old and broken. Come, you two, and stand before
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We obeyed, I wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no other men to equal you, and I need you. You must serve me. Take
      time now, and remember your white blood. Remember that it is stronger than
      your brown, for I have seen its dominance in you today. Remember that when
      your allegiance is tested in a choice between white blood and brown, the
      white will be the stronger. Only one thing can save you and me and all my
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that, Sire,&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;-is your manly pride to see and know and overcome your
      white blood, and serve and obey your king to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and looked from one to the other, as though expecting us to
      speak, but we were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white blood,&rdquo; he passionately resumed, &ldquo;is the most terrible thing in
      the world. It is strong and shrewd; it never gives up; it pursues and
      fights relentlessly to the ends of the earth; without mercy or pity it
      hunts down, plunders, overwhelms, exterminates. Only one thing can hold it
      in check, and that is opposing white blood. Brown blood cannot cope with
      the white people in the valley, but white blood can; and for the task, the
      gods have sent me white blood mingled with brown seeded in my soil and
      grown to it with deep roots. That is my hope and trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gaze of affectionate yearning was on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The duty of your Senatra blood is loyalty to your king; the task of your
      white blood is to outwit and outdo the people in the valley. I will place
      Lentala in command of the army. You must not take a step without her full
      concurrence, and you will obey her without question. Do you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladly, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred soldiers guard the passes from the val ley, and are relieved
      every day. When not on duty they attend to their private affairs. I will
      at once send out messengers summoning these to assemble outside the palace
      wall, in the king&rsquo;s highway passing the main gate. There I will address
      them and turn over the command to Lentala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was profoundly studying me. His words, &ldquo;to outwit and outdo the people
      in the valley,&rdquo; were grinding within me, and I longed to demand an
      explanation. A savage ferocity was manifest through his benignity. To
      outwit and outdo the people in the valley,&mdash;my people, my friends! I
      would be his tool to betray and destroy them. The bottomless pit should
      have him first, and the hand that he would turn to treachery and murder
      would send him thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      My face must have shown something of what I tried to conceal; for the
      king, his look growing desperate and malignant, stepped back a pace. There
      came from somewhere a sharp rap, which made me start, and sent my glance
      to the curtained window, to which the king had his back. I had supposed
      that Beela was with Lentala; but there she was at the window, her hand
      upraised in warning. It brought me instant control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king also had heard, and looked round sharply, but the curtain was
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My big toe, Sire,&rdquo; answered Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cracked the joint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It feels good, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty curiously regarded Christopher&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;It must be a large
      joint,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher stood in gentle silence. The king turned to me, and found me
      docile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That look of rebellion was the white blood in you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a moment. Your Majesty may trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he was troubled, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t no more, Sire,&rdquo; said Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does little things short and big things long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My amused smile was fortunate, because it put an end to the king&rsquo;s tragic
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Now, the first thing for you two to do,
      while the army is assembling, is to go out, find, and bring to the palace
      all the white men that have escaped. The next,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was never concluded, for there came a rumble and a sharp,
      pervading jolt. The king stiffened, looked about in fear, and groped for
      the table. Following was a gentle quiver, which rapidly increased till it
      became an oscillation, and with it a deep rumbling. It ended in a mighty
      wrench and a violent swaying, accompanied with a hoarse explosive sound.
      The stones of the palace were grinding and groaning. The table slid a
      yard, stopped, and shot back as the king tried to seize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself plunging and lurching for a footing as the oscillation
      continued, and so were the king and Christopher. They sat down on the
      floor. Surely the violence would ease in a moment. Instead, the convulsion
      rose to a fearful crash, which sent my feet away and my body smashing on
      Christopher. He caught me with one hand and with the other diverted the
      flying table from the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spasm ended abruptly, but the menacing tremble was again in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; rasped the king; &ldquo;the third is the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As before, the quiver rose through oscillation to a heavy swaying, more
      violent than ever, and ended in a tumult of jerks, which sent us sliding
      and scrambling as we fought the portable things that were hurled about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was suddenly gone. We rose, much dazed. There was no sign of Beela at
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; weakly said the king. &ldquo;The worst in many years. And what has
      it done? It has terrified my people into madness. I see them.&rdquo; He was
      losing self-control, and was staring as at a vision. &ldquo;They are beginning
      to rise from the ground. Many are digging out of their ruined huts....
      Their teeth are chattering. They look at one another in horror. No one has
      a sister, a brother, a father, a mother, a friend. All are blind and
      mad.... They run hither and thither. They&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A confused screech and roar, as of wild animals driven to a focus by a
      surrounding forest fire, rang through the closed door of the room. The
      king listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The palace servants,&rdquo; he mumbled through quivering lips. &ldquo;They are
      seeking me&mdash;their father and protestor. Imagine from this how the
      island is swarming and groaning, and with a terror that is half
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, Sire!&rdquo; I begged, but he did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The terror does not abate: it increases with the freer flow of their
      blood after the shock.... They are beginning to think. They look at one
      another and see their kind; then kindred and friends.... &lsquo;The Black Face!&rsquo; 
      says one, softly. &lsquo;Ay, the Black Face!&rsquo; is the louder reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stood with clasped hands and closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is only the beginning,&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;The Black Face has been denied
      while it looked down on abundance.&rsquo; Who has denied it? The heavens ring
      with the answer, &lsquo;Our father whom we loved, our protector whom we trusted,
      our king whom we have thought a brother of the gods. Why has he flouted
      the Face and challenged its wrath? What terrors or witcheries have been
      wrought by the gods of the people in the valley, that our king has gone
      driveling behind his walls? &lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo; I called, shaking him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened glazed eyes, and listened to the howling din at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guard are leaving the passes. The white people are wise; they
      understand, and are joyful. They send scouts.... My soldiers mingle with
      my roaring, mobbing people. They all push and roll through the pools of
      rain-water in the highways, churning them to mud. They grind their teeth;
      they laugh horribly, like imbeciles. The palace is their aim, and their
      king sits grinning and mumbling there. All the trouble has come from the
      people in the valley. The white blood breeds all there is of that in the
      world. May ten thousand curses fall on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was flinging his arms and lunging about. I woke to the urgency of
      action, for undoubtedly in his madness he had correctly seen the
      turbulence in the island, and the sweating hordes plunging over all roads
      converging to the palace. A glance passed between Christopher and me, and
      I nodded toward the door, which a packed, howling mass was already
      straining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, seizing the tottering king about the waist and dragging
      him to the anteroom. I thrust him within, and secured the door back of the
      curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I turned, Christopher, his hand on the key of the door into the
      corridor, was listening. There was no sign of Beela at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out there?&rdquo; I asked in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; I ordered, stepping back to guard the anteroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it, swinging behind it against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done so suddenly that those pressed against it fell into the room.
      The next came tumbling on them, and more on these, squeezing horrible
      sounds from the mouths of the lowermost, and bringing unpleasant grimaces
      to their faces. In a second the opening was jammed half way to the top,
      and still the pile grew. Behind it were frenzied men and women,
      vociferating prodigiously, and fighting for the diminishing passage to the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pressure outside being somewhat relieved, one of the more agile men
      leaped on the pile and sprang with a howl to the floor; but Christopher
      had emerged, and a blow from him dropped the adventurer. The next, less
      active than the first, was scrambling over the heap, and paused as he
      found himself grazed by the flying body of the first, for Christopher had
      picked him up and tossed him over the heap into the pandemonium beyond.
      The following man drew back, and slid down to the corridor floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been looking for Beela without, but she was not in range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before another maniac could mount the pile, Christopher had dragged a body
      off the squirming mass and flung it out. Another followed, and another,
      and others, the succession of them so close that none dared breast the
      fusillade. Christopher streamed with sweat, and the mildness in his eyes
      had become a glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had a cooling effect in the corridor. Christopher, not waiting to
      look for cracked ribs at the bottom of the heap, cleared the last away,
      and walked forth. None can say how much his unearthly pale eyes, minatory
      expression, and extraordinary figure had to do with what followed. I went
      to the door. A hush fell as he advanced on the mob, which fell back in
      silent terror. With each hand he seized a man, jammed their heads together
      with a murderous thwack, shook them, stood them up, left them stunned, and
      immediately snatched two others and treated them similarly. A third pair
      and a fourth nursed aching skulls. Christopher swept through the groups
      with two long, strong arms for scythes, mowing a wide swath as he brushed
      women along, sent a man spinning from a blow, dashed another against the
      wall, and brought them into subjugation with a counter-panic of his own
      manufacture. He came upon two men with some appearance of character, and
      ordered them to finish the work and send the people to their quarters.
      They obeyed him promptly. At last he sauntered back to me, calm but
      puffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beela approached from the opposite direction. I stepped forward in
      gladness to meet her.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT news, my
      friend?&rdquo; I cheerily inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the king&rsquo;s reception-room and talk,&rdquo; she answered, looking at
      Christopher. &ldquo;Dear old Christopher!&rdquo; she said, deep and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;I left the king in the anteroom.&rdquo; Christopher and I
      followed her into the reception-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not there now,&rdquo; she replied, seating herself, &ldquo;but with the queen.
      Christopher, go and stand down the corridor, opposite the queen&rsquo;s
      apartments, and wait for the king. Those lunatics may break loose again
      when they hear the mob outside the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo; she called. He turned. &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen her so calm and steady, so rich in ultimate qualities, so
      little the volatile, meteoric, yet wise child-woman who had been my
      sunshine, my tease, my playfellow. She had become a composed and gracious
      woman. It came to me with something like pain that this was the truer and
      finer Beela. There was another feeling,&mdash;one of a great need in my
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a becoming dress that might have suited either a woman or a man;
      but everything about her spoke of the sweetness and grace that only a
      lovely woman can have. I was tired of the foolish Beelo sham. We had grown
      too near for me longer to tolerate that absurd barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for your news, dear Beela,&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the slightest start when she heard that pronunciation of the
      name, but she did not turn to me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the earthquake began,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I ran to the queen, for such
      things frighten her dreadfully. After it was over there came the uproar by
      the servants. I locked the queen&rsquo;s apartments and kept them out. But their
      noise frightened her even more than the earthquake, for they battered her
      doors. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to admit them. Presently the king came by the
      private entrance, and although he was badly shaken, the necessity to
      comfort the queen brought him composure. They are together and quiet now.
      Then I came to this corridor, where the servants were massed against the
      door. I could do nothing with them. For a moment I was frightened when the
      door opened, but when I saw what Christopher&rsquo;s plan was, I knew that all
      was safe. I went then and secured the gates opening to the palace
      grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s ahead, Beela?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst,&rdquo; she quietly answered, but gave me a slow, mischievous look
      over that repetition of her feminine name. &ldquo;We have a little time before
      the king comes,&rdquo; she brightly added, &ldquo;and we need it to rest.&rdquo; There was a
      challenge in her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the mob is coming!&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king told me that you and Christopher and I should be quiet till it
      assembles. Then he will come, for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew up my stool facing her, took both her hands, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a confession to make, dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Joseph?&rdquo; she exclaimed in mock alarm, pronouncing the name
      perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know. And you&rsquo;ve been only pretending that English wasn&rsquo;t perfectly
      familiar to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a musical, purring little laugh. Any man would deserve great
      credit for self-restraint in resisting it&mdash;and the chin.
      Thenceforward she spoke in English of the purest accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the confession, Joseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known something for a long time, Beela, and I&rsquo;ve been deceiving you
      with thinking that I didn&rsquo;t know; but I did so because you evidently
      wished me to be deceived. Everything might have gone wrong if I had
      betrayed my knowledge to you. But it has served its time. You will forgive
      me for deceiving you,&mdash;dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that went to make her a miracle of precious womanhood was vibrant.
      There was the same sweet flutter that I had seen before in her velvety
      throat. Of course she enjoyed her little triumph of knowing that even for
      a time her deception had prospered, and she was a-thrill with the
      recollection of it. After that came contrition. A half-smile lingered on
      her lips, though her eyes were rueful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are good and generous, Joseph, for not giving me a chiding word; and
      I don&rsquo;t think there is the least of it in your big heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiding, sweet girl? I understood your feeling for the necessity of the
      deception. Your wish is my law, and to serve it is less a duty than a
      privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight puzzle in the glow that flooded her heavenly eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it out all by yourself, Joseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is remarkable. Neither Christopher nor Annabel gave you the smallest
      hint? They knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the smallest.&rdquo; The hurt of their keeping the secret from me must have
      shown in my face, for Beela laughed teasingly. It restored me. &ldquo;You
      pledged Annabel not to tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and Christopher is silent,&mdash;and
      a gentleman. Is that the explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; A soft embarrassment crept over her, and she gently withdrew her
      hands and sat regarding me in sweet content. &ldquo;I also have a confession to
      make, Joseph.&rdquo; She tried hard to look just a trifle anxious. &ldquo;What, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph!&rdquo; she cried, frowning and stamping; &ldquo;how can I think when <i>that</i>
      is in your eyes and your voice! I won&rsquo;t look, and I won&rsquo;t listen.&rdquo; She
      turned her shoulder to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is in my eyes and my voice, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat still a moment, and then slowly turned her head a trifle and
      peered at me as if baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tease me, Joseph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw my smile and again turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the confession?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the beginning. There were two real reasons why I posed
      as a boy. One was that it gave me more freedom of limb for going through
      the forest and for scaling the valley wall, and the other was that it made
      me less conspicuous to the guards,&mdash;I could have escaped if they had
      detected me. On my word, dear Joseph, I never intended to deceive you long
      about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cautiously looked round at me, for I was silent. A cheap resentment at
      learning that I had been unnecessarily tricked must have betrayed itself,
      for the dear girl took my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you keep it up, dear?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, the time was when your want of perception was mistaken by me for
      dulness, for obtuseness,&mdash;for such a lack of understanding as makes a
      man or a woman not worth while. But I discovered that it was not dulness
      at all. For a time I refused to believe that a human being could have what
      I saw in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If I have ever seen wondering fondness it was in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, dear?&rdquo; I asked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trust which sees only the true, and, unwittingly taking into your
      heart the false with the true, makes the false true with your trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent with the deep thankfulness that God had sent such a woman
      into the world and into my meager life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Joseph, I prolonged that deception until all doubt of what you are
      was gone. I am glad that I did, and am sorry that I can think of no more
      tests.&rdquo; There was a dash of her dear mischief in that speech. &ldquo;And now
      that this is a time of confession and understanding,&mdash;you started it,
      remember,&mdash;I must say that one of the deceptions played on you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;They
      were really harmless, weren&rsquo;t they, dear Joseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that one of them was unnecessary. It was <i>such</i> fun to
      play those pranks on you, Joseph! I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I know it was
      wicked, but you were always gentle and kind, and I knew you would forgive
      me. Joseph, you would forgive me <i>anything</i>, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was delicious to see you walking so trustingly through the
      complications that beset you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; I cried, my senses afloat and my arms aching for her; &ldquo;I am only
      human. Your sweetness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed back her chair before my advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know in the least,&rdquo; she went flying on, &ldquo;how often I had to
      leap from one of my selves to the other, and how exciting it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was getting little out of her chatter except the music of her voice and
      the picture of loveliness that she made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care to know which of the deceptions was unnecessary?&rdquo; she
      demanded, trying to look injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came and stood beside me, gazing down into my face and clasping my
      hand warmly in both her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela?&rdquo; after a mystified pause; then, thinking that she was teasing, I
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared much relieved, and brightly said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you understand
      and forgive me.... But you resented her at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelo had become very precious, dear, and so my readjustments where you
      are concerned are slow. But a new fondness grew with Beela&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Joseph! And <i>she</i> wasn&rsquo;t necessary. I am sorry now that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She?</i> Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was a little taken aback, but came to my feet with a dazzling
      consciousness that all the glories of earth were packed into this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at first, dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but in time she became more necessary than
      my life. My heart sits in gratitude at Lentala&rsquo;s feet for sending me her
      sweet sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was stricken into a statue, and was staring at me as at some strange
      creature from another planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood in silent misery. How had I hurt her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a turn of the room, and flung herself on her knees at the couch,
      buried her face in her arms, and went into laughter mingled with sobs. I
      seated myself on the couch and laid a caressing hand on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela,&rdquo; I pleaded, &ldquo;forgive me. Let me know what I have done that hurt
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t for all the world! My heart is breaking with
      gladness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surely no other mortal could have put such startling contradictions into
      so few words. My hand found hers; she caught it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear old Joseph!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Choseph, Choseph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plainly hysteria; the brave soul had been on a breaking strain too
      long. I drew her to me, bent her head to my shoulder, and pressed my cheek
      to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no resistance, and gradually grew quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;we have been through many trials together, and there
      are more ahead. The days were dark till Beelo came. He stole into my heart
      with hope, courage, and love. A shock came when he passed. I don&rsquo;t know,
      but perhaps I never should have loved you but for him. He was the sunny
      highway leading to you; and now I have the daring to lay my love and my
      life at your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sigh that drifted through her parted lips had no threat for my
      anxiety, but she did not answer. Her hand gently drew mine down from her
      cheek, and she rose. She studied me a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk, Joseph. Perhaps we have been hasty.&rdquo; I noted the patient
      weariness in her voice. She sat beside me, and after a short silence
      resumed: &ldquo;I have never loved a man till&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It hasn&rsquo;t been
      possible here. But you have known beautiful, lovely women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And liked them very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her glance fell, and a little quiver crossed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known Annabel a long time. You were close to her; you and she
      talked long and often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is beautiful and sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exceptionally so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And accomplished&mdash;and gracious&mdash;and has good manners and a
      velvet voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s kind&mdash;and gentle&mdash;and has high principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She belongs to your people, your world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; raising her sad eyes to mine, &ldquo;you have loved her once, and now
      love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never loved Annabel, dear heart, but I do love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you loved her? How could you help it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never told her that you loved her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But, dear Beela, I can&rsquo;t discuss Annabel in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes blazed. &ldquo;She loves you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not true; and no one has the right to say such a thing of a woman
      without knowing that her love is returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beela bit her lip, and came stiffly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unkind!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have a right&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s right&mdash;to
      reasons for believing what is incredible without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picture of outraged dignity that she made was so ravishing that I
      feared my adoration would override the sternness which I had taken so much
      trouble to set in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is incredible, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She impatiently turned away. I think she did it to hide a smile, but she
      was too wary to answer. Instead, she drew from her bosom the little toilet
      case I had given Lentala on the day of the feast, and gravely examined her
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were beautiful like Annabel,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;or Lentala, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and were pink and white&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made exactly such a face at herself in the mirror as Lentala had, and
      suddenly turned on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, Lentala used to be beautiful and good and true, and an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is all of that yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned the case to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you nearly loved her once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My tongue was silent. Beela laughed mischievously; little devils were
      dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, I&rsquo;m serious. Reflect because it wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to act hastily
      now and suffer for the rest of life. Annabel would make a perfect wife.
      She would play no pranks and childish deceptions. You understand her and
      she knows you. I&rsquo;m only a wild, uncouth savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything more, dear?&rdquo; I wearily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered breath to resume: &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Lentala. She is to be a queen
      some day, and very rich. With rank and wealth, she would be a shining
      woman in America, and her husband would be the happiest man in the world;
      for with all of that he would have the far richer treasure of her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy man will come to her some day, Beela.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think she was&mdash;was fascinating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect again, Joseph: Would you prefer her poor, obscure, wild little
      sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But what right have we to make so free with Lentala&rsquo;s name,
      especially as she is foreign to the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Beela was offended, but she controlled herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be ashamed of me with people of your kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alone are of my kind, dear Beela; and shame for you would be shame
      for myself, shame for all that is precious to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, Joseph, that I should refuse to leave this island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The highest privilege of my life would be to stay here with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood in a melting happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rosy mouth was conveniently near. I should have been a fool to let the
      opportunity pass, and she was not on her guard. She drew back too late.
      The dignity with which she came to her feet had a new tenderness. I also
      rose. She gazed at me with a wistfulness that searched all the hidden
      places in my soul. Never had she been so lovely as in this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Joseph, take more time. There is something... you don&rsquo;t know, though
      I... thought you understood. Now I dare not&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A great
      fear fills me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love knows no fear, sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for itself, but for its loved ones. Joseph, will you forgive me? It
      was a foolish thing to do, and I am very, very sorry. Your trust has
      shamed me. Dear Joseph, I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But first let me tell you
      something else. The colony must now be marching out of the valley, for I
      told Captain Mason that a severe earthquake would be his signal for
      starting at once. Annabel is coming, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened to the king and Christopher. His Majesty, anxious and
      broken though he was, gave us an approving smile,&mdash;perhaps from what
      he read in our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My maddened people are gathering,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was wise of you to lock
      the gates, my child. When the crowd grows larger it will begin an assault.
      That will be the time for me to appear. I will call out the soldiers from
      the crowd and put them under your command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That surprised me. &ldquo;Pardon me, Sire. I understood your Majesty to say an
      hour ago that <i>Lentala</i> was to have command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your Majesty has just said that <i>Beela</i> is to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela? I couldn&rsquo;t have said that, as I don&rsquo;t know any such person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was dismayed at the king&rsquo;s apparent condition, and Beela in great
      perturbation was trying to speak. The man must be roused from his shaken
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Beela, Sire, Lentala&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no sister,&rdquo; he answered clearly, and turned sharply on Beela.
      &ldquo;Lentala, have you been playing one of your pranks?&rdquo; He hurried her away
      as she was trying to speak.

      <i>A Mob at the Palace Gate. What the King Heard Through the Wall.
      Lentala&rsquo;s Call on Christopher to Save Her. The King Abdicates. Long Live
      the Queen!</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ABIT is the
      strongest force in animate nature. Though I was shaken, the bent of an
      urgent purpose remained, and I went forward to it with all the will at my
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar of a mob&mdash;that most horrible of sounds&mdash;smote my
      hearing when Christopher and I emerged from the palace into the grounds. A
      turn in a broad, curving walk through the trees brought the barred main
      gate into view. It was a massive affair of wood, iron, and bolts, with a
      small wicket, which was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, all alone, wearing his crown and his cloak of state, was
      awaiting us near the gate. He beckoned us to raise a ladder to the wall.
      It was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will presently go up alone,&rdquo; he said, calm but sad, &ldquo;and will talk to
      them. Men have gone for a heavy beam with which to ram the gate. The crowd
      is densely packed here. That will make an attack on the gate impossible
      for a time. It is likely that the soldiers will assemble and clear a
      working space.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do, Sire?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing now. The most that I can hope for is to hold the situation until
      Lentala returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It was something about the white people. I couldn&rsquo;t keep her. She
      was confident we could hold the mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your Majesty&rsquo;s plan&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show myself on the wall, and talk to them. At the proper moment I
      will call you up. If I am stricken down, you and your brother retreat to
      the palace. Defend it by any means and at any cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sorrow was too great to be companioned by fear, and it bore an
      impressive dignity which his haggardness intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mob is swelling rapidly,&rdquo; he said with perfect quiet. &ldquo;Unless a
      diversion happens soon, many will be crushed against the gate and the
      wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he stood inactive, I wondered whether he was so numbed as to
      be incapacitated; but he cleared the doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the beam-carriers force their way through the mass, many will be
      maimed or killed. I am listening to the sounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His coolness and clearness were remarkable. Christopher, unruffled, was
      studying our surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There come the beam-carriers,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;They are much excited, and
      are not working smoothly together.... One fell then; he was stepped on and
      hurt.... Now they are forging ahead. They are blindly ramming the mass
      before them.... A woman is hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s back was to the ladder and the wall. He was gazing into space
      behind me, listening.&rdquo;... Hark! Yes, that is he,&mdash;one of Gato&rsquo;s
      captains, a big, strong man, with a great voice. He has just arrived,
      fighting his way through the crowd, and calling the soldiers, telling them
      that I have murdered Gato. I have been kind to this man. On the chance of
      Gato&rsquo;s being out of the way, he sees his opportunity to step into his
      leader&rsquo;s shoes, carry out his plan, and usurp the throne.... The soldiers
      are rallying. They fight ruthlessly for passage to the captain.... It is
      bungling, cruel work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the moment for you to appear, Sire?&rdquo; We had to shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He was firm as well as calm. &ldquo;Wait. The soldiers are unwittingly
      preparing my moment. I have partisans as well as enemies there. If I
      showed myself now, it would increase the frenzy. My friends and enemies
      would at once begin a fight of factions. They could not, would not, hear
      my voice. I will let the soldiers clear the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they scale the wall, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will come later,&mdash;by the soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood listening. That was trying to my mercurial nature, and almost a
      mad desire to be over the wall in the thick of the mêlée was straining
      within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king produced a key, handed it to me, and composedly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That opens the vault containing the cargo from the white people&rsquo;s vessel,
      including the arms. If I fall, you and your brother will know what to do
      in defending the palace. But don&rsquo;t be hasty. Be merciful if you can. This
      outbreak will not last long. Violent earthquakes are likely to come again
      at any moment, and the red fire and purple flame on the summit make me
      think that there may be a volcanic eruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will happen then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white people will seize the opportunity to escape from the valley,&mdash;if
      they have not already started. That would mean the annihilation of the
      entire party, for all the Senatras, including the army, would fall upon
      them. Then my people would be satisfied, and order would be restored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My respect for his insight gave his words a crushing force. But what did
      it mean that Lentala had told Captain Mason to bring the colony out?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was moving toward the ladder under an impulse to be in action, but a
      firm grasp fell on my arm. An apologetic look of warning reminded me that
      Christopher never slept when a beloved one was in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had noticed nothing, so deeply absorbed was he. A puzzle was
      sharpening his senses and wrinkling his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew that Lentala was safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could she be in danger, your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her white blood. It makes her too daring.&rdquo; He was looking about, but his
      attitude of concentrated listening returned. &ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer for a while; then, &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a new trouble. It started on the outskirts of the mob, and is
      drawing nearer.... I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at the highest pitch of alertness, and was silent for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear the voice? That is no Senatra! His cries&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
      hear them, man?... The people are falling away from him in terror....
      Don&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are crying, &lsquo;A demon sent by the Black Face! He will take our
      children, and the hungry Face will devour them!&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of it, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people are stricken with fear.... The women are fighting to escape.
      Don&rsquo;t you hear their screams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire. Isn&rsquo;t it time to mount the wall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There is no foreseeing what this diversion will accomplish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is advancing toward the gate, bellowing. Surely you hear him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo; My heart bounded, for I recognized the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is crying in English, &lsquo;They brought me out to eat me!&rsquo; He thinks we
      are cannibals!&rdquo; exclaimed the king, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the white people in the valley think so, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blazed with resentment, but his attention was again concentrated on the
      proceedings without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is calling me the chief of the cannibals,&rdquo; resumed the king, &ldquo;and is
      fighting his way to the gate. He shouts that he must be the first to
      enter, and that he will find me and strangle me.... He is a maniac. The
      natives have a horror of that malady. The noise is subsiding. Don&rsquo;t you
      notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire; and now I will rescue the madman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started for the ladder, but with a fierce grip the king withheld me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be a fool and spoil everything?&rdquo; he shouted in a sudden fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was again composed and listening. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of the
      men, seeing how easily he clears the way, are hailing him as a leader.
      They are not the soldiers.... The beam-bearers are advancing again, for
      the madman is opening a passage. They carry the beam on their
      shoulders.... They are gradually approaching the gate. Don&rsquo;t you hear the
      lunatic shouting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A considerable body of soldiers must be massed at the gate, awaiting the
      bearers, but they are silent. They must be consulting what to do. They are
      drawing their swords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let that happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he peremptorily commanded. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; He was listening more
      breathlessly than before. &ldquo;Strange!... Strange!... It&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I demanded in a rage of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he resumed after a pause. &ldquo;What can make it? There
      is no earthquake. Did you feel one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire. But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; His clutch was on my arm. &ldquo;Surely it can&rsquo;t be the white people
      from the valley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reeled, and I seized the instant to spring upon the ladder. But I had
      forgotten Christopher. He turned me round to face the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stricken monarch was standing in a tenseness sprung from unnamable
      fears. But he started as something new fell on his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not they. Something else. They are growing more quiet....
      It is a woman.... They are hailing her. She speaks. Don&rsquo;t you hear her
      voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could hear only a blur of noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is shaming the women.... And sending them away.... She is my
      friend!... Do you know the voice?&rdquo; He seized my arm and gazed into my
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is fighting her way through the men.... She calls them fools,
      cowards, ingrates.... They are dazed.... Only one woman on all this island
      would have the courage to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, if you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is calling, pleading; she is saying that I am the kind, wise father
      of them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Christopher, and found a startling transformation. No longer
      was he the dull, patient, waiting man. Every nerve was strung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s mouth was open; his eyes bulged; his clutch on my arm
      tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;She is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you must mount the wall. We must rescue her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! She is in little danger. May the gods give her strength!... Hush!
      What is that?... They are going forward with the beam. She is standing
      erect upon it.... Did you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soldiers are advancing with drawn swords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a violent effort I broke the king&rsquo;s grasp and sprang for the ladder,
      but a giant hand fell on my shoulder and thrust me back. Above the
      subsiding din rose a clear, unterrified call from without:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher! Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been waiting for that. His answer rang keen and far, and he leaped
      upon the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come when I call,&rdquo; he said to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he was on the wall. In another he had deliberately sent the
      ladder crashing to the ground. He studied the outer scene a moment,
      crouched, and sprang into the maelstrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five thousand throats opened at the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gate, Sire! Give me the gate key!&rdquo; I shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! It would be death. The ladder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that Christopher must have acted intelligently in throwing the
      ladder. Had he done it merely to delay our ascent? When it was up, the
      king interposed before my clutch at the rungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your king first,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount then, Sire, in heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; cried I, cursing inwardly at the
      delay and my own impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay below until I summon you,&rdquo; said his Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your appearance at this time may bring ruin to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely realizing that he was in the right, I gritted my teeth and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, what was happening to Christopher and Lentala in that swirl of
      blind mob passion beyond the wall, and what meant the groans of men and
      the clang of metal? Christopher might save her life until the king should
      create a diversion, but what could a man do for himself, with a hundred
      swords at his breast?
    </p>
    <p>
      As with dignity and deliberation King Rangan stepped upon the broad top of
      the wall, the afternoon sun came forth in imperial splendor, and wrapped
      him in its glory. He slowly faced the mob, raised his hand, and held it
      firmly aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been seen before assuming the impressive attitude, and a mighty
      shout of mingled adoration and derision arose; it continued jarringly till
      he raised his hand; then gradually it fell into the deep roar of breakers
      after a storm, and thus faded to a silence broken only by the rumble of
      distant hordes moving on the palace. The king swept the multitude with his
      gaze, and spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your king has grown old in service to his people, and now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gato! Gato! Give us Gato!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every true subject of mine holds his life at the service of his king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us Gato!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stood in an iron silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show us Gato! We must see him! We must have him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rangan raised both arms, and a hush fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; his deep voice rang out. &ldquo;You shall have Gato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could recover from my surprise he turned to me, tossed me a key,
      and in a manner that showed his perfect seriousness, ordered me to bring
      Gato immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well with my brother and Lentala, Sire?&rdquo; I begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but go at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dashed through the grounds and the palace to the dungeon door, which
      upon reaching I flung open, and, unable to see within, said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring Gato.&rdquo; An echo as of emptiness buffeted my voice. &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo; I
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stir began to rise. &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; stole a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring Gato!&rdquo; I shouted, with a fury in my voice that brought immediate
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows took dim shapes, stooped and lifted something heavy, and
      shuffled hastily toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my shoulder!&rdquo; I rapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laid him across. I slammed the door, locked it, staggered up the
      steps, and arrived at the foot of the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was still addressing the mob, but his glance fell upon me in
      answer to my call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him up,&rdquo; he commanded. Again turning to the crowd, he said: &ldquo;Gato
      is here. You shall see him; you shall have him. From him you will learn
      what it means to betray your king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was nearly at the top of the ladder, which sagged and cracked under the
      double weight. The king made a detaining gesture toward me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the ladder that I ordered?&rdquo; he asked of those without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Sire,&rdquo; answered a liquid voice that ran sweetly over the wall and
      into my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place it, you men. Good. Now you shall have Gato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I clambered upon the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand him up to face the people,&rdquo; directed the king for all to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dragged the stiffening Gato to his feet, and, my breast against his back
      and my arms locked round his body, turned him to the crowd. An inability
      to credit the senses held them dumb at first. They looked from one to
      another, horror in their eyes. His Majesty was calmly observing; then he
      spoke in the awed silence, and his voice carried grief and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have called for Gato. Behold him! The gods have long, swift arms for
      those who strike at your king and you, O my people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan swept over the multitude; it passed, leaving a stillness
      inconceivably impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wished to see Gato; you have seen him. You demanded him; you shall
      have him.&rdquo; He gave me an order.
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised Gato aloft, and started toward the gate, where the soldiers were
      massed. In a loud voice the king cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfaithful soldiers of the king, take your leader!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0253.jpg" alt="0253 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0253.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      I hurled Gato down among them. The heavy body struck something,&mdash;I
      did not see what. Lentala was standing between the soldiers and the gate.
      Neither Christopher nor Mr. Vancouver was anywhere visible. The people,
      including the soldiers, were smitten deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lentala!&rdquo; rang the king&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A way to the foot of the ladder opened, and the king gave her a hand at
      the top. Deep sadness was in her eyes, as she turned them for a moment
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, still holding her hand, reached for mine also. Standing thus
      between us, he addressed the throng:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My people, these two and the one who leaped from the wall have been tried
      as by fire. They would die for their king if he but gave the word. You
      have seen Gato. Behold these!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed on the cowed soldiers, and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soldiers of the king, did I but raise my hand, thousands of my loyal and
      loving people would rend you where you stand. What should be done, my
      children,&rdquo; turning to the mob, &ldquo;to honored and trusted sons who would
      steal upon their father to strike him down with an assassin&rsquo;s knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur which rapidly swelled, and a stir which began to seethe, warned
      the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A king can forgive. My soldiers were never bad at
      heart; they were led away. Soldiers of the king, raise a hand in token of
      your loyalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one obeyed. Besides those at the gate were many throughout the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your faithless leader gone, I appoint Lentala, my daughter, as commander
      of the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a craning of necks. The soldiers made no concealment of their
      surprise, but in their gratitude for the king&rsquo;s pardon shouted their
      acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king laid his hand on Lentala&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now make this proclamation: I am old and broken, and the grief of this
      day has brought me near the end. To this one, true and wise, brave and
      devoted, so deeply loved and trusted by us all, I resign the ruler-ship of
      my people.&rdquo; He removed his crown and cloak, and placed them on her. &ldquo;Obey
      her as you love her, and peace and security will abide with you. This is
      your ruler henceforth.&rdquo; He raised both arms, and, after a pause, cried,
      &ldquo;Obeisance and greetings to Queen Lentala!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thrill ran through the gathering, and all sank to the ground. I was on
      my knees at her feet, pressing her fingers to my lips and trying to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph!&rdquo; she scolded under her breath, giving my hand a little squeeze;
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that! How can I cry when you are so absurd!&rdquo; Tears were falling
      from her lashes. She turned, put her arms on the king&rsquo;s shoulders, and
      bowed her head, while mighty salvos of huzzas rent the skies.

      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;Wit and Dash to the Fore.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The New Sovereign Assumes Charge. Our Plans for Escape Go Awry. Victims
      Taken to the Sacrificial Altar. A Bold Act Turns a Tragic Event.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was some time
      before Lentala could lift her face to her subjects. The king&rsquo;s
      renunciation&mdash;the finishing touch to the bold diplomacy with which he
      had turned the crisis&mdash;had come to her as a bolt from heaven. I
      wondered how it would affed her deeply laid plans for the rescue of the
      colony; for, though it would give her extraordinary power, it would
      abruptly check her irresponsible freedom of movement. Furthermore, it had
      thrust upon her the necessity for swift rearrangement. Her hold on neither
      the people nor the army had been firmly secured. I knew that her quick
      understanding apprehended the new complications, and that she understood
      the king&rsquo;s wisdom fitted to the hour&rsquo;s need. She gave me a frightened
      look, and brightened under my smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      With reassuring words the old man disengaged her hands, stepped back, and
      left her to face the crowd. Thus she stood alone between us. It seemed a
      cruelly trying moment in which to place a girl, but she made the fight to
      face her duty. It was not long. Her voice, tremulous at first, stole out
      clear and fine, reaching to the limits of the crowd; and as she proceeded
      it came rounder and fuller, bearing the richness that I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my people. With the deepest love I accept the crown, and I
      pledge my life to wear it worthily. Only love and trust me as you have
      loved and trusted the good father who has ruled us so long and so kindly,
      and you will find me faithful. This great change comes upon us at a trying
      time. Neither a king nor a queen can govern a people without their consent
      and love and confidence. Give me time to show that I am worthy of all that
      from you. I shall still have the advice of the good man who has placed
      upon me the crown, and of his able advisers. But I shall trust your own
      hearts and heads more than all the wisdom of the palace. I shall trust
      your confidence in me more than my power over you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know that there is a special cause for the present unrest. But be
      patient. The problem is not difficult, and you may depend upon me and my
      advisers to solve it. Every impatient act of yours shows distrust of your
      government, and if you rashly do anything to weaken the power of the
      crown, you lay yourselves open to dangers. The white people in the valley
      are only awaiting the moment when authority is destroyed and our people
      are in disorder to come forth and work havoc among us. They stand together
      as one, and are cool and not afraid. Those are the greatest powers that
      human beings in community can have. If you had worked your will today, how
      many of you would be alive tomorrow? Our beautiful island would have
      flowed with blood&mdash;the blood of our people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased for a moment, to observe the effect. It ran as a low,
      frightened murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nothing can go wrong if we ourselves keep cool and hold together and
      trust to the crown. The army will camp tonight in the palace walls, and
      every care will be taken to keep order in the kingdom. All will be well if
      you yourselves are calm. Therefore I command you one and all to go at once
      to your homes, and remain there in quiet and peace. No matter though
      storms may come, or the earth tremble, or the fires under the ground break
      forth, be not afraid; trust your queen and your army, for we have no fear.
      Be as brave and cheerful as we. All your problems will be solved, all your
      reasonable wishes will be granted, but that must be done by your queen.&rdquo;
       She raised her arms in the manner of Rangan, and impressively added: &ldquo;Go
      now, with my love and my blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another wave of affectionate loyalty swept over the multitude; it began to
      disintegrate, and to pacify and turn back belated incomers; but a shrill
      cry rose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrifice! Give us a sacrifice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had an instant effect. The moving crowd halted, and the cry ran to many
      throats, &ldquo;Sacrifice! Sacrifice!&rdquo; The queen turned to old Rangan, and he
      almost imperceptibly nodded. Lentala hesitated as she faced the mob again,
      but refrained from looking at me. She raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrifice! Sacrifice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest was drowned in a threatening shout. Lentala stood dazed, and in
      the ensuing buzzing and movement lost any opportunity she might have
      desired for further speech. So she stood as the still noisy crowd
      straggled off. Unrest had been rekindled, but to what extent I could not
      guess. The last loiterers often stopped to gaze at the little group on the
      wall, and the army stood in soldierly ranks before the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The army will salute the queen,&rdquo; commanded Lentala.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was finely given with the sword, and the men heartily responded to the
      oath that she gave them as soldiers of the queen. With a gesture to us
      that we follow, she tripped down the ladder, opened the gate, and admitted
      the army to the grounds. Next, after sending to liberate the soldiers in
      the dungeon, she had the palace astir with an order to prepare for the
      army a feast and accommodations for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rangan had been a silent observer of her whirlwind movements. I was not
      wholly satisfied with what I saw in his face, but with whatever else that
      I saw there was admiration. Obviously she was permitting him to remain
      until he should be satisfied that she was capable of assuming command of
      the army. As matters were quieting she asked him to go to his wife, and he
      tottered away, shaking his head and mumbling to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ordered the army to break ranks. The men showed their relief with
      childish inconsequence, and scattered at will. That left us alone. The
      bright look that she turned to me was a sudden change from royal sternness
      to Beela&rsquo;s challenge. She was my little work-mate of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had risen between us; consciousness of it showed in her glance,
      and I was sore without that. To have tricked me so unnecessarily, as to
      Beela seemed wanton and cruel. Unreasonable as it may appear, I had been
      shocked so deeply that time for recovery would be required. I had seen the
      craftiness with the gentleness of the native blood in old Rangan. I had
      seen his hatred of the white man, and the merciless savagery that his show
      of benevolence masked. It had made me distrustful of the native blood,
      which composed half of Lentala. To the sweet, childish Beela whom I loved
      had been added something that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started, but could not bring a smile into the look that I gave her, even
      though the call had been Beela&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to hear what has happened to me?&rdquo; she asked, ignoring my
      stolidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stiffened slightly under that address, and subtly put Beela aside for
      the queen. With a hint of coldness she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning of the outbreak I foresaw that Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s guard
      would decamp; so I went to look after him; but he had already gone after
      being left alone. I followed him. That brought me to the crowd. When I
      found myself in danger there, I called Christopher. His daring leap from
      the wall and the fury with which he laid about him confused the crowd. He
      was helped by some loyal subjects whom his conduct inspired. I don&rsquo;t know
      how many skulls he cracked, but no one was killed. I pointed out the men
      for him to silence. No one could resist him. When he called for the king
      to ascend, he took Mr. Vancouver in charge and slipped away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, but she must have seen my gratitude for her taking such risks on
      Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s account. Doubtless that was what made her eyes flash, but
      at the moment I did not know why. I reflected only that two matters of
      overshadowing importance must be attended to at once, and that possibly
      her plans had been disarranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of Christopher and Mr. Vancouver, your Majesty?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Christopher to take Mr. Vancouver to the hut, where Mr. Rawley was
      waiting,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and then go to meet the colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. What is to be done with the colony, and what am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes, and there was no trace of Beela in them. &ldquo;I had asked
      Captain Mason,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;to have each member of the colony bring all
      the food possible, and had told him that you and Christopher would meet
      him in the first darkness following the earthquake, at a certain pass just
      to the west of the clearing where the sacrificial altar is, and that as
      the natives would be demoralized by the earthquake, you could lead them
      without much risk past the settlement to your vessel, which might be
      sailed away at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wonder and gratitude at the intelligence of her plan must have shown in
      my face, but her tone had no warmth when she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately, matters have turned out so that I can take the army out of
      your way. The real danger lay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was why she had admitted the soldiers to the palace grounds and
      locked the gate. Could any other have given so brilliant a turn to a
      threatening situation? Yet I only looked at her in silence, and her face
      had not a trace of the old friendliness. Perhaps it was my own fault.
      There rang in my ears the demand for a sacrifice; I recalled old Rangan&rsquo;s
      nod; I remembered the defenseless position of Rawley and Mr. Vancouver;
      and the brown blood in the Senatra queen unaccountably looked different
      from the brown blood in Beela.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will go now and see that all is well with Mr.
      Vancouver; then I will go and assure a clear opening for the colony, and
      arrange for Mr. Vancouver and Rawley to join us as we move down the
      eastern side of the settlement to the harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. I was turning away, but she stopped me. &ldquo;You will
      reflect,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that many people in the island are ignorant of what
      has taken place here today. I will send out runners, but still the entire
      island can&rsquo;t be covered. All know that a white man has been held for
      sacrifice to the Black Face in order to stop the earthquakes and avert an
      eruption. If the earthquake returns, even the people who saw me crowned
      may become uncontrollable. Should that happen, I am not sufficiently sure
      of the army to trust it in stopping a sacrifice. There is just one thing
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and regarded me waitingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hardened still more. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s consider the situation calmly. If some
      very strong diversion should arise tonight, the colony could pass through
      to the vessel without risk. On the other hand, the people are alarmed and
      restless; they won&rsquo;t sleep soundly; many may be abroad in every direction.
      If some of them should see the colony escaping, a cry might be raised that
      would ring from one end of the island to the other. That would mean the
      instant gathering of a mob which no power could resist, and the colony
      would be annihilated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, your Majesty. What diversion would prevent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sacrifice of Mr. Vancouver and Rawley.&rdquo; She spoke in a cold,
      business-like tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My horror must have been evident. &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; I said with warmth,
      &ldquo;before that shall be submitted to, every member of our colony will die
      fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged. &ldquo;That is your affair. I should hate to see any of <i>my</i>
      people killed in such a clash. It is interesting to see how jealous you
      are of Mr. <i>Vancouver&rsquo;s</i> safety, when he had planned to destroy the
      colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw the drift of her sneer, and was angry and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a very charming daughter,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The humiliation that she was thrusting upon me was unbearable, but I could
      be patient, since I carried the lives of the colony in my hands; yet it
      was not pleasant to see this side of Lentala&rsquo;s nature. The worst of it was
      that there was no possible argument to bring against hers. Mr. Vancouver
      richly deserved such a fate, and so did Rawley; their meeting it would
      certainly assure our escape to the <i>Hope</i>. But Lentala could see in
      my attitude nothing but consideration for Annabel, and she misconstrued
      that. It was all that I could do to restrain myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we understand each other,&rdquo; she remarked after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; I burst out in a passion, &ldquo;that you are going to order the
      sacrifice of Mr. Vancouver and Rawley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me steadily. Afterward I recalled the softening, the
      suffering, the dumb pleading in her face, but I did not see it at the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t appear,&rdquo; she quietly said, &ldquo;that I am called on to tell you
      any more of my plans at present. You are fully informed as to what you may
      do in trying to get the colony to the ship tonight.&rdquo; Her manner was
      entirely that of a queen to her subject. &ldquo;I think you understand to some
      extent what I have done to spare the lives of your people and help them
      leave the island. I will add that some trusted natives will try to make
      your passage to the ship safe. But it is one thing to make plans and
      another to carry them out in the face of a panic. There is no foreseeing
      what may happen before morning. My scouts will keep me informed every few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came an awkward pause. Her head was down; she stood in a waiting
      attitude. It seemed to me that all the world I loved had suddenly been
      swept away. Behind the woman confronting me I knew that my dear Beela
      stood sweet and laughing, all sunshine and dear womanliness. Only a fool
      would let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beela!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, and raised sorrowing eyes to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going with us on the <i>Hope?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty is here now, and I can think of nothing but that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your unexpected elevation to a queenhood blot out all the past?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t expected that from you,&rdquo; she said in sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, is it Annabel?&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer at once. &ldquo;You will see her again this evening,&rdquo; she
      gently said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I saw it was useless, and wondered
      if she was dismissing me. &ldquo;Surely I shall see you also,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but it was not the smile of Beela; it was that of a woman who
      knows care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;yes, of course,&mdash;I think. Meanwhile,
      good-by,&rdquo; and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it, and would not at first let her withdraw it; but with a little
      sigh, which she tried to conceal, she turned away and walked slowly to the
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy-hearted, but determined to see Lentala before the colony sailed,&mdash;if
      it should ever have that good fortune,&mdash;I went about my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first task was to see that Mr. Vancouver was safe, for many
      contingencies might arise to overwhelm Christopher. I went to the hut
      where Beela had left Rawley, but it was vacant. Christopher must have
      taken the two men to a spot near the pass, to meet the outcoming colony.
      On going to the summit of the valley wall I faced the rising moon. When I
      had come within a few hundred yards of the spot where the colony would
      emerge,&mdash;it was the spot where Rawley had assaulted me,&mdash;I heard
      the low moaning of a man, followed by his querulous, childish talk. At
      first I marveled that Christopher should have left his charges in so
      exposed a place, as it was immediately near the main trail to the
      sacrificial stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she come soon?&rdquo; Mr. Vancouver plaintively asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon. Be patient,&rdquo; kindly answered Rawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were invisible in the gloom, but it was imprudent for them to be
      speaking aloud. Yet I dared not show myself, lest Mr. Vancouver be thrown
      into noisy mania. Should the natives be seeking him, it would be easy to
      trail him to this spot; and the colony might be discovered through his
      presence. Again Mr. Vancouver broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t suspect me, does she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is and always will be your loyal daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; His voice was not a madman&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Raise my head a little. It is
      bursting. Rawley, I&rsquo;m damned. The visions I&rsquo;ve had! In one of them two men
      came, looking like natives, but speaking English. One of them spoke of my
      treachery and my death. I tried to kill him. The other prevented me, and
      then I saw that they were Tudor and Christopher. And today the one looking
      like Christopher rescued me from a hell of madmen. But how could I stay in
      that cabin when Annabel was coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rumbling and a quivering of the earth hurried me on. I ran to the edge
      of the valley wall. This brought me nearly opposite the Black Face. I had
      noticed a faint, weird light on the trees; now I saw the origin of it,&mdash;a
      purple flame was issuing from an orifice below the Face. It waved upward
      like an inverted streamer, wreathing the Face and lending to it a ghastly
      lifelikeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      From below me rose faint cries of terror, quickly stilled, and soon the
      vanguard of the colony arrived from the valley. The earth-trembling had
      ceased; the flame was subsiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some trouble at first in making myself known. Annabel came up
      with Captain Mason and Christopher, and delayed my disclosure of the plan
      for escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; she immediately asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I informed her, and learned that Christopher had told her all that he
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to him,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that it would be safer to bring him to her. Directing
      Christopher to fetch a stretcher from which a woman had just been lifted,
      I left with him as the slender procession crept to the summit. Deep
      anxiety showed under Christopher&rsquo;s calm exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vancouver and Rawley were gone! A hasty search in the vicinity failed
      to discover them. We worked down to the trail leading to the clearing
      where the sacrifices were made. There we found a stream of silent,
      soft-footed natives hurrying toward the clearing. No speech was needed
      between Christopher and me to explain the situation. Christopher&rsquo;s wise
      plan had gone tragically awry. It had not been difficult for the dognosed
      natives to trail Christopher to the hut, and then Rawley and Mr. Vancouver
      to the spot where I had found them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thrown into a momentary confusion. Lentala alone had known whither
      Christopher was to take Mr. Vancouver, and she had argued for his
      sacrifice as the surest means to save the colony! The thought was
      sickening. But it was inconceivable that <i>Beela</i> should have the
      heart for such a course,&mdash;sweet, gentle Beela! And had not Lentala
      nearly forfeited her life to the mob in trying to rescue Mr. Vancouver?
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had slipped from my mind; but I observed him now, and he was
      listening far. I waited, knowing that by this time the two victims were
      already at the altar, and that the earthquake a few minutes ago had lent a
      fierce impetus to the proceedings. I could mentally see the main
      settlement and its outlying regions swarming as the whispered news flew
      from mouth to mouth that two white victims for the sacrifice had been
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher soon turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get wood, sir,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That will take time, but there are many men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lentala had said that her scouts would report often; but there was a
      chance that they would either conceal the present movement from her or
      give her the news too late. Even should she be starting at that moment, it
      would not be possible for her to arrive in time to stop the sacrifice. Yet
      she should be informed. If she refused to come, then I should know&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go and tell the queen.&rdquo; I said nothing of a
      desperate plan that I had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher looked at me strangely. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And you can
      save &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a look of dog-like love, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Captain Mason, avoiding Annabel, and rapidly placed the
      entire situation before him. His jaws set hard in the moonlight. I could
      imagine his thoughts, which no doubt agreed with Lentala&rsquo;s; and I realized
      the terrible risk to the colony when the fanatics should find themselves
      balked in the sacrifice and should swarm in a search which the colony
      could not escape&mdash;unless my plan should prove successful to the last
      detail or the queen should bring up the army in time to prevent a battle.
      And there was mighty Christopher, the man of courage, resourcefulness, and
      prompt action. I hurled these arguments at Captain Mason, and pointed out
      Annabel, standing alone and suffering as she awaited her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Hobart and I will make the dash,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;It is the only
      chance, and we must hurry. Dr. Preston can be taken into the secret, and
      can quietly prepare the men to fight if necessary. They are all armed; the
      savages are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He responded by calling Dr. Preston and charging him as I had suggested,
      particularly warning him not to alarm the colony. Then he went to Annabel
      and gave her some quieting explanation. I borrowed a capable knife from a
      sailor, and we set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bore down to the trail, and found it still swarming with a scurrying
      horde, all proceeding with a stealthy swiftness. Then I struck out on a
      straight course through the tangled forest, leading Captain Mason and
      Hobart a breathless pace. On arriving at the edge of the clearing and
      concealing ourselves, we found hundreds of savages already assembled and
      more pouring in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they are.&rdquo; I said, pointing to a considerable open space between
      the sacrificial stone and a packed mass of men formed in a semi-circle,
      those in front sitting. Midway between the stone and the natives were the
      two doomed men, dim in the moonlight. The one lying on the ground was
      doubtless Mr. Vancouver, perhaps unconscious. Rawley, though his hands
      were tied behind him, sat erect, calmly facing his tormentors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Captain Mason and Hobart had no disguise, I alone must bring the two
      men out. My companions would take them to the colony; I would remain to
      face the issue and divert the pursuit. Captain Mason looked very grave,
      but Hobart was all eagerness; I could guess that his sore spirit yearned
      to heal itself by sharing my risk. A longing for Christopher,&mdash;for
      his far-seeing eye, his steady nerve, his quick hand,&mdash;came over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; I explained in showing why I should not make the dash at
      once, &ldquo;that a ring was fastened in the rock about where Mr. Vancouver and
      Rawley are sitting. They must be chained to it. I must wait until they are
      released.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We knew that the delay would mean an augmentation of the crowd and the
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the theft of the wood had been discovered. The hut sheltering it
      had disappeared; its poles and dryer thatch were already piled on the
      altar. The sacrifice was only delayed, for two-score natives were coming
      in with dry wood for which they had foraged. In that pursuit one came near
      us, and I made ready, but in his eagerness he passed on, unseeing. The
      priest at the altar received the wood, examined it, cast out the useless,
      and carefully stacked the pyre, which steadily grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence rested on the crowd. Here was religion in its naked birth,&mdash;the
      elemental man using torture and murder for prayer, with greater reverence
      and faith than I have seen in some modern fashions of placation or appeal.
      Fronting them across the dim chasm of the valley was the embodied Force
      whose wrath must be appeased. Could the white blood in Lentala permit this
      form of worship?
    </p>
    <p>
      We could see through the trees the indefinite black mass of the Face. At
      small intervals came low subterranean growls and slight tremors of the
      earth. It was as though the underground gods were gathering their
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the priest&rsquo;s work was done. He slowly went to the chained men,
      stood over them, and raised his hand. Four men came forward, followed by
      four others, who took positions back of him. Twenty more came and formed a
      cordon about the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first four knelt, and the chains fell clanking. Rawley rose without
      assistance. Being speechless with a gag, he implored in dumb show for Mr.
      Vancouver, offering himself alone. There was a low colloquy between the
      priests and the four, at the end of which his gesture commanded that Mr.
      Vancouver also be taken to the stone. As two men stooped to lift him and
      two others took each an arm of Rawley, the priest began a solemn chant in
      a minor key, and started the slow march to the pyre, Mr. Vancouver on the
      shoulders of two men, Rawley walking firm and erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the altar the priest ceased his chant, which was taken up by the crowd;
      but, though there were many hundreds of voices, they were so soft and in
      such fine unison that the volume was hardly greater than that of a dozen
      men. As it proceeded, the priest picked up a vessel containing smothered
      coals, blew them into life, and ignited the thatch at the four corners.
      Evidently the victims were to be further tied, and tossed aloft when the
      fire was hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the priest stepped back to see the blaze rise, I bounded into the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that the fire was hot in my face as I reached Rawley and nipped
      his thongs, and that the astonishment on the priest&rsquo;s face was comical.
      Also, I was conscious of a numbness in my right hand. I had used my fist
      perhaps more vigorously than necessary. Two or three natives were prone
      when I shouldered Mr. Vancouver and called to Rawley, and the darkness of
      the forest soon concealed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar delayed by astonishment rose behind us; a thousand devils had
      opened throat and were leaping to the pursuit.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER a hard run, I
      laid Mr. Vancouver across Hobart&rsquo;s shoulder. There was no need to urge all
      speed to the colony. I turned back to meet the pursuers, and ran swiftly
      until I encountered the foremost. Before they had seen me I dropped to the
      ground and was diligently examining it when they came up and halted,
      others running behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; inquired the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed, but my knife was ready for a contingency. I pretended to lose
      the signs, but found them again, followed a few paces, and announced that
      the fugitives had turned there and headed for the trail. &ldquo;That will bring
      them into a trap,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;for people are still coming up the trail to
      the clearing. I will follow the runaways and give the alarm. You men
      spread up and down here, for they may double back. When others come from
      the clearing, turn them all back, for they will spoil the trail and I
      never can find it again. Then you too go back if you don&rsquo;t hear from me
      very soon. Send a man at once to the priest, and tell him to hold the
      people there, and to order up more wood and prepare for the sacrifice. I
      am a Suminali man and can trail like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was turning away, but paused, to make sure of them. &ldquo;Have you heard the
      news from the palace?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has given the crown to Lentala, and the command of the army
      also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It surprised them. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Gato?&rdquo; asked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He disobeyed the king, and is dead,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Tell the news to the
      priest. Spread it among the crowd.&rdquo; It was on my tongue to add that the
      queen would soon appear with the army and disperse the crowd, but there
      were dangers in it, and I held my peace. Sufficient for the present that I
      had stopped the pursuit.

    </h5>
    <p>
      On arriving at the road to the clearing I found a commotion, and learned
      that the army was rapidly approaching. The people did not know how to take
      that news,&mdash;whether it meant a forwarding or a breaking up of the
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a scrambling of stragglers to escape the army, which advanced
      on the trot, Christopher running in front. He saw me, wheeled, and raised
      his hand. I knew that his glance at my face had told him the whole story.
      My heart swelled to see Lentala, borne aloft in an uncanopied crimson
      velvet palanquin emblazoned with the royal insignia. Her dress was the one
      she had worn at the feast, with the addition of the crown. In her hand she
      carried a naked sword, fine and lean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way for the queen!&rdquo; at intervals shouted a man running ahead of the
      queen and behind Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing Christopher&rsquo;s signal she raised her sword, and the palanquin
      halted. She was anxiously watching the glow from the altar fire, but her
      glance discovered me, and a surprised joy sprang to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I too late?&rdquo; she called in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your Majesty. All is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; she chokingly cried, throwing her sword away and seizing both
      my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a public scandal. The soldiers stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her a warning look, and said, &ldquo;Your Majesty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew away with freezing dignity. A soldier picked up her sword, wiped
      it as he would a baby&rsquo;s face, knelt, and handed it to her. She slammed it
      angrily into its scabbard, gave me a crushing glance, and opened her lips
      to speak, but I drove the words back by suddenly dropping in an obeisance.
      I would have given a good deal to see her face in the long pause before
      she bade me rise. My face was grave as I met her angry, suspicious gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time nor place to make fun of me,&rdquo; she cuttingly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your Majesty&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was studying me. &ldquo;You have seen Annabel, I suppose?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And talked with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;were glad&mdash;to see each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as lovely as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She examined the splendid jewel in the head of her sword-hilt, looked up
      with a composed face, and demanded that I tell her what had happened. I
      did so, and she beamed, forgetting Annabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the army to the clearing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;put a stop to the
      nonsense, and send the people home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said it confidently, either ignoring the danger or ignorant of it.
      Evidently her purpose was the protection of the colony, but I surmised
      that some power greater than hers would be required. Christopher had been
      standing near, a silent listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her imposing arrival had a strong effect on the restless mob as in the
      cross-light of the moon and the altar fire she stood up in the palanquin
      and raised her sword for attention. She told them of her crowning, made a
      plea for their confidence, and commanded them to go home. But she said
      nothing about a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sign of obedience appearing in the crowd, she gave me a glance that
      sought guidance. I knew that the moment was critical and the risk great,
      but it seemed the only recourse. I glanced at the army. She understood,
      hesitated a moment, and ordered the soldiers to clear the place. A slight
      movement and a buzz ran through the ranks, but there was no forward
      movement. Then rang a cry, instantly taken up till it became a roar:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrifice! Sacrifice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lentala sprang to the ground, waved the palanquin-bearers away, and with a
      free sword confronted the soldiers, her head high, her eyes flashing. I
      knew she realized that there was but one way out of the desperate dilemma,
      and that she was casting about to find it without a confession of failure.
      Clearly she knew that, although old Rangan had deeply planted a sense of
      loyalty in the soldiers, she was hampered both by a want of experience in
      handling them and by the pressure of the mob behind her, which was
      swelling its demand for a sacrifice to a mutinous outbreak that the
      soldiers would have no spirit to meet, they being in sympathy with the
      movement. It became necessary for me to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang forward and prostrated myself before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; she said, extending her sword over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had come to my feet she gave me her sword, and said, her voice
      ringing clear and far:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go among my people and quiet them. You were King Rangan&rsquo;s friend;
      you are the man who threw Gato from the wall,&mdash;Gato, who had been
      unfaithful to his sovereign. I give you command of my army while I go
      among my people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her sword and promptly faced the bewildered ranks as Lentala
      drifted away; but not until I had seen that Christopher was observing; he
      would understand that I had turned her over to his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that on the beach and during the march to the valley I
      had closely observed Gato&rsquo;s method of handling his men. They were crude
      soldiers and their drill was childish, but my training knew the value of
      discipline to any extent, and I remembered Gato&rsquo;s tactics. More important
      than any evolutions that they knew was the spirit of the one commanding
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rapped out an order for company formation, as the men were in loose
      order. As I had expected, some of them stared at me and the others at the
      rapidly growing mob spirit before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be explained that Gato&rsquo;s organization was wholly different from
      that of civilized nations. While the men composing the army came nearly to
      half the number of a modern regiment, and while some rude idea of
      subsidiary groupings had been observed, the absence of actual experience
      in warfare had made the organization hardly more than a stolid, pompous
      mob, and the under-officers little besides repeaters and enforcers of the
      general orders. All officers were merely the &ldquo;general&rsquo;s&rdquo; staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did the best I could with such a machine. Upon repeating my order in a
      still sharper tone, and seeing only an uneasy, tentative pretense of
      obedience, I sprang toward the officer whom I may call the
      lieutenant-colonel, stung his cheek with the flat of my rapier, and sent
      him spinning down the ranks. Another officer instantly found himself
      treated to a similar slap, and another, as I continued to shout the order.
      The fourth, a sullen brute, took the blow without wincing, and in both
      hands began to raise his sword to cleave me. He never knew what it was
      that sent his blade clattering to the ground; and his attention at once
      became engaged in a spouting rip in his arm. That brought the staring
      regiment to its senses; the under-officers all sprang to their duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, charging up and down the front rank while I raked the stomachs of
      the soldiers with my sword, I ordered platoon formation. Under other
      circumstances it would have been amusing to see the officers scrambling
      for minor commands not already occupied. Evidently there had never before
      been such sprightly movement required of them; my rapier continually
      flashed, and men winced when it came near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus secured control, I was in a dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      My purpose was to face them about, so that they should not see the
      turbulence rapidly increasing in the mob; but that would bring them facing
      the altar fire, which was burning emptily, reminding them that the people
      had been cheated. But there was no choice; I must be where I could face
      the storm breaking over Lentala and Christopher. There was no time for
      marching to secure a back-presentation to the mob; I must risk the
      awkwardness of a reverse formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command to about-face was promptly obeyed, and the soldiers appeared
      to be surprised on finding me again before them. It was necessary to keep
      them absorbed in maneuvers, which, of the simplest kind, such as they
      could understand, I immediately put in force.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not distract my attention from the turbulence centering about
      Lentala. I saw the densely packed and highly excited mob crowding her; I
      heard the shouts for a sacrifice, the calls to the army to join the
      rebellion; I heard her clear, steady voice; I saw now and then glimpses of
      Christopher standing as a rock behind her; and all the time my sword was
      swinging and my orders were keeping the army at work. It would be but a
      matter of time when I might turn it to the service of the queen, but the
      danger was pressing alarmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden there was a commotion about Lentala. Before I could turn over
      the command to the officer next in rank and go to Lentala&rsquo;s rescue,
      Christopher, bearing her on his shoulder, broke through the mob, skirted
      my left flank on the run, and bounded toward the altar, the flames of
      which had sunk almost to a mass of glowing coals, exceedingly hot. Without
      attempting to comprehend his movement, but seeing that he had brought the
      queen behind the army for some purpose, I instantly opened the order of my
      men, commanded swords drawn, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s army to her defense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The command was taken up by every subordinate officer. Again the men found
      me facing them as the mob came howling at my back; but the double line
      stood firm as an interposing wall before the queen. Then I knew that I had
      them in hand, but I dared not risk a charge, and I must see what
      Christopher was doing. The tumbling mob halted before the drawn swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christopher reached the altar he stopped and turned, he and his
      burden making a striking silhouette against the red heap of coals. She
      appeared unconscious, for she hung limp over his shoulder, her arms
      pendent. The halting of the mob and Christopher&rsquo;s pause aided his
      unexpected dash in sending a hush on the crowd. In the midst of it rose
      Christopher&rsquo;s voice for all to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sacrifice the queen! The queen!&rdquo; With that he flung her to the
      ground and began savagely to tear her outer skirt into strips, with the
      obvious purpose of binding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was clear to the mob through the open ranks of my men. I was no
      less appalled than were the savages at the audacity of the move and
      Christopher&rsquo;s ferocious method of procedure. And I made no attempt to keep
      the soldiers from turning their heads to see. My task was instantly to
      find my cue in the drama that Christopher was playing. It came before I
      was ready. As Christopher, after the binding, which required but a moment,
      was carrying Lentala up to the pyre, she began to struggle, and called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soldiers, save me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bounded through the ranks as I gave the command to about-face and
      forward double-quick. But I outran the soldiers, struck Christopher down
      with my sword, and caught Lentala as she was falling. The shortest instant
      was needed to cut her bonds, but that was sufficient for me to lose
      control of the situation. Christopher&rsquo;s splendid ruse had succeeded in
      saving the queen from the mob, and I knew that nothing concerning himself
      mattered beyond that. Indeed, I have always thought that he deliberately
      chose the time to give his life for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old king had said, the natives were children, and the sudden
      revulsion of feeling in favor of the queen was more even than the
      soldiers, who had a little discipline, could calmly bear. A wave of
      passionate devotion swept over them. It was only a mob that I faced with
      my sword as I stood before Lentala. Christopher was lying face downward on
      the ground as he had fallen. I knew he was unhurt and free to make a fight
      for his life. None could have realized more clearly than he that the mob
      would take vengeance on him, but none could have better understood that
      his resistance might imperil the queen. He had simply made the bold play
      for her sake, had won, and then lain down to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not bear that, nor could Lentala, who comprehended. Without
      hesitation she left me and bent over him, to receive the blow, and was
      careful that he should not know her purpose. I did what I could, shouting,
      commanding the soldiers to form, waving my sword menacingly. It had a
      staying effect, and I cannot now say with certainty that it would have
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with a sickening sensation, I felt the earth tremble beneath my
      feet. A strange sense of dizziness, of reeling, made my movements waver.
      The soldiers also were staggering, and their purpose to rend Christopher
      appeared to be relaxing; but nothing could withstand the pressure of the
      mob behind them. I had barely time to snatch up Lentala and cut a way back
      to the altar before Christopher, whose glance found Lentala and me safe,
      began to rise as the lurching horde hurled itself upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a staggering run, nearly tripped at every step, I bore her to the edge
      of the clearing, on the side toward the colony, and hid us both in the
      shadows. When I had picked her up she buried her face in my shoulder and
      clung to me with both arms round my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A volcanic eruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand on her lips, and she trembled as she clung closer. She was
      silent as the earthquake increased in violence, and presently asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see it, Choseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had been observing it since we were seated. &ldquo;Yes. It is at the river
      passage. The mountain appears to be blown out there, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, holding me closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly the eruption had occurred at the boiling cauldron that we had
      passed under the mountain. Its first violence was already spent, and the
      earthquake was subsiding; but I reflected that the water from the valley
      stream and from the crimson fall must be pouring into the hot interior,
      and that the end was not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ejecta of the outburst were already falling about us from the great
      height to which the explosion had thrown them. Hot stones of all sizes
      rained. Had not the forest been damp, it would have broken into flame at a
      thousand places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writhing savages in the clearing were but dimly visible. No
      definiteness came out of the mass still crowded and heaped where we had
      left Christopher. All sufficiently near for me to see sat staring at the
      Face, which was now clearly taking its vengeance; all were moaning and
      howling, and prostrated with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep-red flame rose with a rushing noise from the seat of the eruption
      as renewed rumblings and roarings came from the quivering ground. The
      rising flame plunged into a rapidly spreading canopy of smoke and ashes
      from the initial explosion. The hither edge of the vast cloud was wan in
      the moonlight, but the under surface reflected the crimson of the flame.
      All things adopted that dreadful hue. The green foliage took it on as the
      muddy purple of decay; the brown faces of the natives looked as if beaten
      to a pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came another light, and it woke a more insidious terror. Striating
      the crimson column and issuing snakily from many independent orifices
      distributed over a wide area of the valley rim, was the purple flame. And
      now the most wonderful of all was the great Face itself. The crimson light
      caught it in profile, and thus so sharpened its features as to make it
      seem a living monster of inconceivable ferocity. Nor was that the worst.
      The purple flame again issued from below the face with a great
      augmentation. In rising and spreading it cast a thin veil over the visage,
      making it ghastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The falling of heavy stones ceased, but the more numerous small ones began
      to pelt us. I drew my coat round Lentala&rsquo;s head, and broke tree-branches
      within reach to shield her body, for the stones had a vicious sting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat was growing, both by radiation from the crimson column and by
      reflection from the canopy. Flames were leaping from the forest near the
      eruption, for the heat was drying the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ground opened in many seams under the strain, steam found numerous
      issues on the front of the opposite valley wall, near the Face. The
      quaking of the earth deepened; the moans of the natives became cries of
      frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it growing worse, Joseph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been Beela since the scene at the altar, and I had nearly
      forgotten Lentala. It was sweet to feel her breath on my neck as she clung
      like a frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brave,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Remember, we came safely through the passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Joseph,&rdquo; but I felt a sob against my breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The increasing heat began to make wild mischief in the air. Little
      whirlwinds had been rising, twirling leaves upward. All at once they
      ceased, leaving an ominous calm. Then came a rushing, swirling roar, with
      the crashing of trees,&mdash;the noises of a tornado. I looked round.
      Nearly in a line with the moon rose a spinning column bearing upward
      dismembered trees, liberating them far above, and sending them down
      destructively. This monster, whose seizure would mean death, was mounting
      the slope in its approach to the volcano, and seemingly would sweep the
      clearing in its passage. I did not know what to do, and did not wish
      Lentala to see what was coming, but I must unconsciously have given an
      alarming sign, for she silently caught her breath and tightened her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was looking about in helplessness, an extraordinary vision of tatters
      and despair staggered toward us out of the forest, peering about. Her
      staring eyes found me, and she stopped in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annabel!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lentala sprang to her feet, her terror gone, and stared for a moment;
      then, springing forward, she took Annabel in her arms before I had reached
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; begged Annabel, recognizing us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is safe with Captain Mason at the colony, dear,&rdquo; Lentala sweetly
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confirmed the news, and because she was much more deeply shaken than
      Lentala, I took her to myself and made her sit on the ground. I seated
      myself beside her, took her hand, and told her cheerful things about her
      father and Mr. Rawley. She had become suspicious and left the colony to
      search for her father before Captain Mason&rsquo;s return with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quietly sobbing in gratefulness. A woman&rsquo;s gentler offices were
      needed now, and I looked round for Lentala. To my astonishment she had
      disappeared. That alarmed me. In looking about for her without leaving
      Annabel I discovered that the tornado had torn away the trees on the
      opposite side of the clearing, and was breaking to pieces after tumbling
      into the valley; but I could not guess what havoc, if any, it had wrought
      in the clearing, and a profound uneasiness on Lentala&rsquo;s account made my
      duty to care for Annabel irksome. Even at the best, the collections of the
      tornado were falling about us and on the clearing, and an increase of the
      dismal howling indicated cruel results, in which both Lentala and
      Christopher might be involved. And the danger to Annabel and me was great.
      I did what I could to protect her from the merciless rain of riven timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been impossible for me to abandon hope on Christopher&rsquo;s account.
      Even though I believed that he had lain down in perfect content to give
      his life for Lentala, the eruption had offered him an opportunity for
      which he must have been ready. If he was alive and anywhere near the zone
      of Lentala&rsquo;s danger, she would be cared for. I could accept no other faith
      than that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel reasonably secure and quiet, I noted the progress of the
      catastrophe, knowing that Christopher would let me hear from him soon, if
      at all. The trembling of the ground had become remittent and more violent.
      The cries of the natives were falling to despairing moans. The tripping
      ground had made their flight impossible, even had fear not paralyzed them.
      Besides, the effect of the weird light on the Face was sufficient to hold
      them in a fascinated helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volcanic pillar of fire had shortened, for the still spreading canopy
      was thickening downward. The roar was louder, with occasional detonations
      from lateral explosions which smashed the mountains environing the western
      end of the valley and made a still wider breach in the opening blasted by
      the first outbreak. The purple flame had found new exits, lending the
      opposite valley wall a cadaverous light, and, with the spreading flame
      issuing from below the Face, giving the horrible visage an unspeakable
      hideousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worse than all that had gone before came next. The canopy suddenly effaced
      the moon, and looked like an enormous mushroom on a blood-red stem.
      Violent gusts of wind fell here and there with a rending force, working
      havoc in the forest and among the natives. Now and then rose a sharp
      solitary cry from one struck by a falling stone or spattered by blistering
      mud. At times a swarm of cries rang from the dip of scorching gases.
      Clouds were gathering. Lightning flashed between them and the canopy; the
      crash of near thunder swelled the tumult. I tried not to think of the
      colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Lentala?&rdquo; cried Annabel in my ear, rousing out of a half-stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone to the clearing,&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and find her,&rdquo; urged Annabel in fright, forcibly withdrawing from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am safe here, and will wait for you. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed, staggering into the clearing and falling over the kneeling or
      prostrate savages. My heart presently gave a bound of joy; for, working
      side by side, fearless and devoted, were Lentala and Christopher,
      apparently unhurt, and doing all they could to pacify the frantic natives,
      encouraging them, binding their wounds, and sending them to the service of
      others, thus rapidly starting centers of control and help that enlarged
      with magical rapidity. I came near, but the two who were dear to me did
      not observe, so intent were they on their duty. I had never seen so lovely
      a look on Lentala&rsquo;s face, and I determined to let no foolish barrier stand
      between us thenceforth. Christopher saw me first, but gave no sign
      whatever. Then Lentala, and there was a divine light in her startled,
      happy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to me, didn&rsquo;t you, Joseph?&rdquo; she said, seizing my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annabel discovered that you were gone, and sent me to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face went blank, and she dropped my hand. Terrible though the moment
      was, her childishness angered me. It was no time for coquettish
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants your Majesty,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Shall I bring her to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed, but she replied, &ldquo;Take me to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to take her hand, in order to lead her, for the ground was rolling
      and there were unpleasant things to see on the way in the red glare; but
      she walked alone and as steadily as I. As we approached the trees there
      came a sickening heave different from the earth-movements before.
      Christopher sprang past us toward Annabel, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down&mdash;on your faces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized Lentala and lurched ahead, but before we had quite reached
      Annabel and Christopher we went down in a blazing crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake yourself up, sir,&rdquo; came in a thin voice from a great distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could open my eyes but a moment under the vigorous shaking that
      Christopher gave me, for slimy, warm drops were falling on my face; but I
      had met the darkness that the blind know. A painful throbbing made my head
      roll as Christopher dragged me to shelter and propped me against a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I asked. My groping hands found a prone body at my left. I
      opened my eyes, and the world was blotted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they both here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; came feebly from the body under my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      My arms went round her and drew her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Annabel, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unconscious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lentala lay collapsed in my arms. The rain of mud from the canopy pattered
      and splashed about us. The ground was still, and there was hardly a sound
      except the slimy drip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The volcano has stopped, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked the next question in the conviction that I had been stricken
      blind: &ldquo;Is there any light at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lentala clutched me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Choseph! I thought I was blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened, Christopher?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world blew up, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain had extinguished the forest fires, and the sirupy drip was
      mingled with the hissing of hot stones. There was nothing to do but wait.
      Wails began to creep out of the silent clearing. Lentala drew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor children!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can teach them better now. There&rsquo;s a good
      life ahead for me here.&rdquo; Clearly she was thinking of nothing else, and she
      said it with a simple earnestness. During all these dark months her every
      plan and act had been for her own and our escape from the island. I had
      thought that she accepted the crown as a temporary expedient to restore
      order and save the colony; but now I knew that, while she still intended
      to send us safely away, she had severed all other bonds and would give her
      life where it was most needed. The conduct of the people during the
      eruption had given the finishing touch to her decision. It was the putting
      away of all her hopes and dreams; it was the dismissal of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat a moment in a desolate silence, and found her hand. She returned my
      clasp, but it was different from any she had ever given me before. It grew
      firmer, imparting a silent message of finality.

      cargo had kept me away from the queen and Annabel, who had become devoted
      friends; but a more potent barrier had been her Majesty&rsquo;s cold reserve
      under her assumption of her queenly duties, which had been exceedingly
      severe. The destruction of the Black Face by the eruption had been
      joyously accepted as heaven&rsquo;s endorsement of her accession to the throne,
      and the natives idolized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed clearer than her wish that I do my part to make as smooth
      as possible her determination to forget what had passed between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confident, therefore, that she would carry off the parting pleasantly, and
      appreciating her kindness in inviting me, and her tact in providing for
      Annabel&rsquo;s presence, I went with as stout a heart as I could command.
      Christopher and I had long ago laid aside our disguise. He led me in
      silence to the private room where Lentala had dreamed of a bright life far
      away. A table was set daintily for three; and as there were no native
      attendants, I knew that Christopher was to serve. Rangan was near the end
      of his days, and Rawley gave constant attendance on deeply stricken Mr.
      Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I entered, I heard the queen and Annabel chatting with astonishing
      gaiety in an adjoining room, the doorway into which was closed with a
      curtain. Whatever they were discussing was interrupted by my entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; came challengingly from beyond the curtain. It was Beela&rsquo;s
      voice, though every trace of her had disappeared since the eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; I responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Aren&rsquo;t you going to behave?&rdquo; It was Beela&rsquo;s scold and the
      impatient stamp of her foot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite ready. Annabel will entertain
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel came out. The sparkle in her eyes and the flush in her cheeks
      showed that she was excited, despite her effort to appear at ease.
      Christopher&rsquo;s strange manner had already made me watchful, and I caught
      the knowing look that Annabel gave him. My heart bounded. Could it be that
      the queen had decided to renounce her kingdom and go with us? It so
      deluged me that for a moment I did not heed the chatter proceeding from
      the other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; came thence; &ldquo;have you neither ears nor a tongue?&rdquo; The voice
      rang with a cheer that even Beela&rsquo;s had never known. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been
      trying to make you guess why I&rsquo;m so happy, and you don&rsquo;t show the
      slightest interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to know,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annabel and her father and Mr. Rawley have decided not to go away, and
      Annabel and Mr. Rawley are going to be married!&rdquo; She hurled it
      breathlessly, as a child in a hurry to tell important news.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was the great secret. But why had they kept it from me? An acute
      silence within accompanied my own. I was smiling at Annabel, who blushed
      deliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. I hate it. Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are going to leave me.&rdquo; She said it dolorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something was dropped clattering to the floor within, and then came a
      sudden hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the queerest, brightest twinkle in Annabel&rsquo;s eyes as she studied
      me. In astonishment I glanced at Christopher. The look with which he met
      mine was one of benevolent kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Christopher!&rdquo; came softly from the other room; then, after a
      pause, &ldquo;How can Mr. Tudor manage without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; He made the audacious answer while calmly regarding me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can it be believed that I dared not see Lentala&rsquo;s challenge, and that
      something which I could not master held me a silent fool in the chair?
      Surely there must be men besides me whom love makes humble and timid. I
      have seen men love with a different measure; I have seen love make them
      bold and reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher had adroitly seated me with my back to the curtain. Hence I
      did not see a signal that Annabel, who was facing it, must have received,
      for with some excuse she withdrew, taking Christopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen&rsquo;s voice was close to the curtain as she called in a breathless,
      frightened way, &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could rise she was on me like a whirlwind, clapping her hands
      over my eyes from behind and pressing me down into the seat. Her cheek
      rested on my head. I thought the beating of my heart would suffocate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the silence I sat in a trance. One soft hand held my eyes closed;
      the other slipped down and was pressed on my lips. I knew that Beela had
      come back, and I would submit to any outrage from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph,&rdquo; she said in her sweet, coaxing voice, &ldquo;sit still and don&rsquo;t try
      to speak. You are much more interesting when you don&rsquo;t talk. And then, I
      don&rsquo;t want to be interrupted, for I&rsquo;m going to tell you a story. It is
      about two girls and a man. Nod if you want to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls are named Beela and Lentala. The man imagines he is or <i>was</i>
      in love with one of those girls.&rdquo; The voice above my head became very
      impressive. &ldquo;Now, sir, you are the Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll easily agree that Lentala is much more dignified and reserved than
      Beela.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never so erratic and unconventional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that Beela is rude and bold, wears outlandish clothes, and adopts
      scandalous disguises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My head was still for a time, so happy was I in her delicious fooling;
      then I nodded enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew she was trying to suppress a laugh; she ostentatiously sighed, and
      said: &ldquo;You agree to that. It isn&rsquo;t all. She tells fibs, and is heartless
      and cruel.&rdquo; I was motionless for a breathless space, and then nodded
      viciously. There came a long, still pause. I could bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph! Stop! You hurt my wrist,&rdquo; and again she held me prisoned.
      &ldquo;There. Be quiet. Well,&rdquo; with a resigned sigh, &ldquo;I suppose the foolish man
      will keep on loving Beela and hating Lentala, and end by breaking poor
      Lentala&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am not positive that I entirely succeeded in suppressing my laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to be Beela, then,&rdquo; the sweet voice went on. &ldquo;But, Choseph,
      suppose the madcap should really be very different from what she ever
      appeared to you, and you should discover that she had deceived you about
      an important matter,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t be certain that you know all her
      disguises,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you think her unworthy of your trust and love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very decided shake, and above me a soft laugh and a little squeeze of my
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph, you know you had suspicions about her skill in staining you and
      Christopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had nearly forgotten it; but as her father had been a white man and her
      mother a native, her skin would require some staining to look exactly like
      a native&rsquo;s. I made no response to her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph, suppose a very little girl born in some other country had been
      wrecked with her father on this island. She might have been yellow, or&mdash;or
      almost anything. As she grew, it might have become necessary that she be
      given the color of the natives.&rdquo; There was a pause, and then came the
      hurried question, &ldquo;She&rsquo;d still be the same girl, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, simply to please her, for her chatter meant no more to me than
      that Beela was playing and teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, Joseph.&rdquo; She was really serious. &ldquo;Once, when Lentala dressed like
      Annabel, you were shocked, and said some strange things that made her very
      unhappy and uneasy, and she was afraid to tell you the whole truth. And
      for other reasons she thought it best to keep up the deception. Could <i>anything</i>
      new that you might learn about her change your regard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, but was puzzled and uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she gently said, pressing her sweet cheek to my temple, &ldquo;it could
      make no difference at all what her real color is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I shook my head. It was impossible for me to accept the absurd
      suggestion, and my simple lie could do no harm in her pretty play.
    </p>
    <p>
      She straightened, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;That is a promise,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else. Now, no matter if, in showing her love and pity
      for the poor grown children who need her, she permits these islanders the
      harmless play of calling her their queen when they mean their leader,
      their teacher, their mother,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t she still be only Beela, and
      none the worse for accepting that love and trust and duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My nod was reverential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Joseph, she would know her utter inability to discharge that task.
      She would stumble; she would fall many a time. There would come dark hours
      when she yearned in bitter loneliness for the help of a wise head and sure
      hand; for there is a people to civilize as well as govern. Joseph, the
      heart of a woman is a woman-heart under either a toy crown or a real one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave no sign. There came a long pause, a deep breath, and a sudden
      change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph, suppose that some day a big, fine cavalier, with a tender heart
      and a strong hand, should drift to the poor little kingdom and find its
      queen torturing her soul over problems that would look so large to her and
      so small to him. It seems to me that he would be moved to offer her his
      services. She might make him her Prime Minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tore myself loose, rose, and confronted her. Gazing at me was a
      beautiful young white woman, frightened and blushing, a thousand startled
      imps dancing in her eyes as she backed away. I was profoundly shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Joseph.&rdquo; It came tenderly, wistfully, from the perfect lips
      of Beela and in her dear voice. And those were her eyes; that was her
      delicate, high-bred nose, and that her light hair. And she was as daintily
      dressed as ever Annabel had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Choseph!&rdquo; she cried, stamping in a passion as I gazed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So overcoming a weakness assailed me that I had to catch the top of a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I understand,&rdquo; I said, unevenly, and floundered on, with
      pauses: &ldquo;I might have guessed, but... a cherished ideal is very real to
      me. When I lost Beela and found Lentala, I lost what I had come to love.
      No, not lost,&mdash;I am very foolish and blundering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Joseph.&rdquo; Her smile was dazzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never could be lost while I lived, and would live had she died. It was
      Lentala, not Beela, who put Beela away, and then me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I thought, Joseph. I meant to be kind. And I never had the
      least idea until today that Annabel cared for Mr. Rawley. I thought she
      loved you, and that you had been very fond of her till Beela came. I
      reasoned that it would be best for you to go to your own country, marry
      Annabel, and forget Beela.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sweet speech explained everything, but it was not possible for me to
      feel the ease in the presence of her radiant loveliness that I had felt
      toward Beela, the child-woman, the sprite, who could flutter into a man&rsquo;s
      heart and abide forever. I managed to say bluntly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. And now that all is clear, may I stay and do whatever lies
      in my power and devotion to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was regarding me curiously, and with a touch of uneasiness. &ldquo;Simply
      because I&rsquo;ve asked you?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my dearest wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the strange look was in her eyes. I dared not interpret it as my
      heart commanded; I had never loved a woman before, and needed time to
      gather my courage. Of a sudden an impulse moved me to step forward, take
      her hands, and look deep into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me stay,&rdquo; I begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad and proud if you would, Joseph. You know Captain Mason is to
      return with the <i>Hope</i> as soon as he can, and will bring teachers and
      a clergyman from America, and Annabel and Mr. Rawley will be married
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know what it was that she saw&mdash;or that her sensitive pride
      made her see&mdash;in my face that made her quickly withdraw her hands and
      step back as her eyes flashed and her cheeks crimsoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joseph! I never dreamed that you could think I meant&mdash;<i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my love, my joy, dear heart. When the clergyman comes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel and Christopher entered. The queen flew at her, embraced her and
      kissed her, and then, standing off in front of Christopher, cried in a
      teasing voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christopher, you <i>do</i> love me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he placidly answered as he set the chairs for luncheon.

contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
